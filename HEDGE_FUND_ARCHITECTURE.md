# DEPARTMENT OF GAMBLING - HEDGE FUND ARCHITECTURE

## Complete Operational Framework for 4-Fund Strategy

**Primary Data Source:** Action Network Pro ($14.99/month)
**Supplementary Data:** Odds API (20,000 calls/month)
**Analysis Engine:** Claude Code

---

# SECTION 0: CORE PHILOSOPHY

## 0.1 The Decision Framework

**Action Network = DATA INPUT, Claude = DECISION MAKER**

Action Network provides the signals. Claude determines if they make sense.

For every potential bet, quickly answer:
- **WHY would this edge exist?**
- **Is there a reason the market is wrong?**

```
If you can explain WHY in 1-2 sentences → PROCEED
If you can't explain WHY → PASS (even if signals are lit)
```

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Sharp money on Celtics because Tatum questionable news just broke and market hasn't adjusted"
- ✅ "Public hammering Cowboys but they're 2-6 ATS as favorites this year - recency bias"
- ✅ "Model edge exists because market underweighting Heat's home rest advantage"
- ❌ "Signals are lit but I can't explain why the market would be wrong here" → PASS

## 0.2 FUND INDEPENDENCE (No Combining)

**CRITICAL: Each fund operates 100% independently.**

- VectorFund analyzes → outputs ITS picks with ITS unit sizing
- SharpFund analyzes → outputs ITS picks with ITS unit sizing
- ContraFund analyzes → outputs ITS picks with ITS unit sizing
- CatalystFund analyzes → outputs ITS picks with ITS unit sizing

**NO BOOSTING:** If two funds like the same game, they each list it separately with their own reasoning and sizing. Units are NEVER combined or boosted.

**UNIT SIZING PER FUND (based on that fund's conviction):**
- 0.5-1.0u = Low conviction (barely qualifies)
- 1.0-1.5u = Standard conviction (solid edge)
- 1.5-2.0u = High conviction (strong edge + confirmed)
- 2.0-2.5u = Very high conviction (multiple signals within that fund)
- 3.0u = MAX - only for absolute slam dunks (rare, maybe 1-2 per week)

**OUTPUT FORMAT - Always list by fund separately:**

```
VECTOR FUND PICKS:
1. [Pick] - [Units]u @ [Odds from Odds API]
   WHY: [explanation]

SHARP FUND PICKS:
1. [Pick] - [Units]u @ [Odds from Odds API]
   WHY: [explanation]

CONTRA FUND PICKS:
1. [Pick] - [Units]u @ [Odds from Odds API]
   WHY: [explanation]

CATALYST FUND PICKS:
1. [Pick] - [Units]u @ [Odds from Odds API]
   WHY: [explanation]
```

**Never combine funds. Never boost units. Each fund stands alone.**

## 0.3 WHY Requirement (Mandatory for Every Pick)

Every pick must include a 1-2 sentence "WHY" explanation:

| Fund | WHY Format |
|------|------------|
| **Vector** | "Model edge exists because [injury/matchup/market slow to adjust to X]" |
| **Sharp** | "Sharps like this because [information edge/value on line move/market overreaction]" |
| **Contra** | "Public is wrong because [recency bias/overreaction to last game/popular team tax]" |
| **Catalyst** | "Situation mispriced because [market doesn't weight rest/travel/revenge enough]" |

**If you cannot write the WHY sentence → DO NOT BET**

## 0.4 Red Flags Check (Kills or Reduces Bet)

Before finalizing any pick, check for red flags:

| Red Flag | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Conflicting sharp signals** (Sharp Action lit on OPPOSITE side of your pick) | PASS or reduce to 0.5u |
| **Key injury announced** after Action Network data was updated | Re-evaluate, likely PASS |
| **Line moving hard against your side** (2+ points since you identified it) | Reduce to 0.5u or PASS |
| **Obvious trap game indicators** (too-good-to-be-true line, everyone on same side) | Extra scrutiny on WHY |
| **Your pick matches 80%+ public** on a "sharp" or "model" play | Verify it's not a trap |

```
Red flag present = Reduce to 0.5u OR PASS
Multiple red flags = PASS regardless of signals
```

## 0.5 DAILY LIMITS & VALUE FOCUS

**UNIT CAPS PER FUND:**
- Maximum 6-8 units per fund per day
- This is a CAP, not a target - if only 2 units of value exist, bet 2 units
- Never force picks to hit a number

**VALUE IS EVERYTHING:**
- Only bet when genuine value exists
- Every pick must pass the "WHY would the market be wrong?" test
- If you can't explain the edge clearly, it's not a bet

**CONVICTION HIERARCHY:**
- Analyze ALL qualifying plays first
- Rank by conviction (edge %, signal strength, multi-fund agreement)
- Take only the TOP plays that fit within unit caps
- Quality over quantity - 4 high-conviction plays beats 12 mediocre ones

**CONFLICT RULE:**
- If two funds take opposite sides of same game, pick the STRONGER signal
- Don't bet both sides (burns juice)
- Exception: Only hedge intentionally if both have genuinely strong independent reasoning

**PLAYER PROPS PROCESS:**
1. First, analyze all Action Network prop projections provided
2. Research each prop - player averages, matchup, minutes, situation
3. Calculate edge and determine value
4. THEN access Odds API for additional props or line verification
5. Props must meet 12%+ edge threshold (higher variance)

**WORKFLOW ORDER:**
1. Read all screenshots/data
2. Run 4-fund analysis on ALL games
3. Identify highest conviction plays
4. THEN access Odds API for props
5. Output final picks with full reasoning

## 0.6 TIERED ANALYSIS PROCESS

Not every game gets deep research. Use this filtering system:

**TIER 1 FILTER (Quick Scan - All Games):**
Using Action Network data only, flag games that have:
- Edge 5%+ OR Grade B+ or higher (Vector candidates)
- Sharp Action OR Big Money lit (Sharp candidates)
- Public 70%+ on one side (Contra candidates)
- PRO Systems triggered (Catalyst candidates)

Games with ZERO flags = SKIP entirely

**TIER 2 FILTER (Deep Research - Flagged Games Only):**
For games that passed Tier 1, web search:
- Injuries (last 24 hours)
- Rest/travel situation
- Recent form (last 3-5 games)
- Head-to-head history if relevant
- Any news that affects the line

Ask: "Does this research CONFIRM or KILL the edge?"
- Confirms = stays in consideration
- Kills = remove from picks

**TIER 3 FILTER (Final Conviction - Top Candidates Only):**
For remaining games after Tier 2:
- Access Odds API to verify lines
- Check for better odds across books
- Pull player props if relevant
- Rank by conviction
- Select TOP picks within unit caps

**THE KEY QUESTION:**
Before any bet is finalized, answer:
"Why is the market wrong, and what do I know that the line doesn't reflect?"

If you can't answer clearly = NO BET

**PROPS ANALYSIS:**
For Action Network props provided:
1. Quick scan for edges 15%+
2. Web search player's recent games, minutes, usage
3. Check matchup defense rankings
4. Odds API to verify/find best line
5. Only bet props where research confirms edge

# SECTION 1: UNIVERSAL FOUNDATIONS

## 1.1 Fund Independence Principle

**CRITICAL: Each fund operates INDEPENDENTLY.**

The 4 funds are designed to have different philosophies that will often disagree. This is intentional—this IS the hedge.

- VectorFund might say BET Team A based on model edge
- ContraFund might say BET Team B because public is heavy on A
- SharpFund might say BET Team A because sharp money is there
- CatalystFund might say PASS because no situation applies

**All of these can happen on the same game. No conflict resolution is needed.**

If two funds take opposite sides of the same game, BOTH bets are placed from their respective fund bankrolls. This diversification of approach is the entire point of the multi-fund structure.

## 1.2 Bankroll Structure

| Fund | Starting Capital | Base Unit (1%) | Max Single Bet | Max Daily Units |
|------|------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| VectorFund | $10,000 | $100 | $300 (3u) | 6 units |
| ContraFund | $10,000 | $100 | $300 (3u) | 6 units |
| SharpFund | $10,000 | $100 | $300 (3u) | 6 units |
| CatalystFund | $10,000 | $100 | $300 (3u) | 6 units |
| **TOTAL** | **$40,000** | - | - | **24 units** |

## 1.3 Dynamic Unit Sizing (Based on Bankroll)

```
Unit Size = Current_Bankroll × 0.01

If fund = $10,000 → Unit = $100
If fund = $12,000 → Unit = $120
If fund = $8,000 → Unit = $80
If fund = $6,000 → Unit = $60 (and review strategy)
```

## 1.4 Kelly Criterion Formula

```
Full Kelly % = (b × p - q) / b

Where:
- b = (decimal odds) - 1
- p = your estimated win probability
- q = 1 - p

We use QUARTER KELLY:
Recommended Stake = Full Kelly % × 0.25 × Bankroll
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Estimated probability: 58%
- Odds: -110 (decimal: 1.909)
- b = 0.909
- Full Kelly = (0.909 × 0.58 - 0.42) / 0.909 = 11.6%
- Quarter Kelly = 11.6% × 0.25 = 2.9% of bankroll
- On $10,000 fund = $290 bet (round to $300 = 3 units)

## 1.5 Implied Probability Conversion

```
Negative odds (favorites):
Implied % = |Odds| / (|Odds| + 100)

Positive odds (underdogs):
Implied % = 100 / (Odds + 100)
```

| Odds | Implied Probability |
|------|---------------------|
| -200 | 66.67% |
| -150 | 60.00% |
| -130 | 56.52% |
| -115 | 53.49% |
| -110 | 52.38% |
| -105 | 51.22% |
| +100 | 50.00% |
| +110 | 47.62% |
| +120 | 45.45% |
| +150 | 40.00% |
| +200 | 33.33% |

## 1.6 Expected Value (EV) Formula

```
EV% = (Your_Probability × Decimal_Odds) - 1

If EV% > 0 → Positive expected value → Consider betting
If EV% > 3% → Good edge
If EV% > 5% → Strong edge
If EV% > 8% → Excellent edge
```

## 1.7 Breakeven Win Rates

| Odds | Breakeven % | Need to Win |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| -115 | 53.49% | 54+ out of 100 |
| -110 | 52.38% | 53+ out of 100 |
| -105 | 51.22% | 52+ out of 100 |
| +100 | 50.00% | 50+ out of 100 |

---

# SECTION 3: FUND-BY-FUND ARCHITECTURE

**Remember: Each fund operates INDEPENDENTLY. Conflicting positions are expected and intentional.**

---

## FUND 1: VECTOR FUND

### 3.1.1 Philosophy
Pure mathematical edge detection. We use Action Network's model projections as a baseline and verify with our own analysis. Bet when model edge is significant and we agree with the direction.

**Props belong to Vector Fund** - Action Network Pro has prop projections with calculated edges. All prop bets are placed through VectorFund.

### 3.1.2 Data Requirements (Action Network Pro)

| Data | Action Network Location | Required |
|------|-------------------------|----------|
| Opening Line | PRO Projections → OPEN | Yes |
| Current Line | PRO Projections → CONS | Yes |
| Model Projection | PRO Projections → PRO LINE | Yes |
| Model Edge % | PRO Projections → EDGE | Yes |
| Model Grade | PRO Projections → GRADE | Yes |
| Best Available Odds | PRO Projections → BEST ODDS | Yes |
| Public Bet % | PRO Projections → BET % | Context |
| Public Money % | PRO Projections → MONEY % | Context |

**Supplementary (Web Search):**
| Data | Source | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| Team stats | TeamRankings, NBA.com | Verify projection |
| Key injuries | ESPN | Adjust projection |
| Rest/schedule | ESPN | Factor into edge |

### 3.1.3 The Quant Formula (Simplified with Action Network)

**Step 1: Read Action Network PRO Projections**
```
PRO_LINE = Action Network's model projection
CONS = Current consensus line
EDGE = Action Network's calculated edge %
GRADE = A+ to F rating
```

**Step 2: Evaluate the Edge**
```
Action Network recommends: "at least Grade B or +3.5% Edge"

Edge Tiers:
- EDGE < 3%: No significant edge → PASS
- EDGE 3-5%: Moderate edge → Consider
- EDGE 5-8%: Good edge → Bet
- EDGE > 8%: Strong edge → Max conviction
```

**Step 3: Cross-Reference with Our Analysis**
```
Check via web search:
- Are there injuries Action Network might have missed?
- Is rest/schedule favorable?
- Does our quick projection agree with PRO LINE?

Agreement_Score:
- Action Network EDGE positive AND our analysis agrees → High conviction
- Action Network EDGE positive BUT our analysis has concerns → Medium conviction
- Action Network EDGE positive BUT our analysis disagrees → Low conviction or PASS
```

**Step 4: Final Decision**
```
Quant_Bet = TRUE when:
- GRADE >= B OR EDGE >= 3.5%
- No conflicting injury/situational factors
- Our analysis confirms direction
```

### 3.1.4 Vector Fund Decision Matrix (Main Lines)

| Action Network Data | Our Analysis | Action | Units |
|---------------------|--------------|--------|-------|
| EDGE < 3%, Grade C- or below | Any | PASS | 0 |
| EDGE 3-5%, Grade C+ | Agrees | Consider | 0.5-1.0 |
| EDGE 3-5%, Grade B- to B | Agrees | Bet | 1.0-1.5 |
| EDGE 5-8%, Grade B+ or above | Agrees | Strong Bet | 1.5-2.0 |
| EDGE > 8%, Grade A- or above | Agrees | Max Conviction | 2.0-3.0 |
| Any positive EDGE | Disagrees | PASS or Reduce | 0-0.5 |

**Example - Wizards +10.5 (from screenshot):**
- PRO LINE: +7.1
- CONS: +10.5
- GRADE: A-
- EDGE: +8.5%
- Decision: Max conviction (2.0-3.0 units) if our analysis confirms

### 3.1.5 Vector Fund Props Analysis

**Props belong to VectorFund.** Action Network Pro has prop projections with EDGE calculations.

**Action Network Prop Projections:**
- Navigate to Prop Projections page
- Use Cmd+A copy/paste to capture data
- Look for EDGE column on player props
- Example: Drummond Over 10.5 pts, Projection 14.43, Edge +28.6%

**Props Decision Matrix (Higher Thresholds Due to Variance):**

| AN Edge % | Action | Units |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| < 12% | PASS | 0 |
| 12-20% | Consider | 0.5-1.0 |
| 20-30% | Bet | 1.0-1.5 |
| 30%+ | Strong | 1.5-2.0 (cap) |

**When Action Network doesn't have prop data, use Odds API + Web Search:**
```
Player_Projection = (Season_Avg × 0.5) + (Last_5_Avg × 0.3) + (Matchup_Adj × 0.2)

Matchup_Adj:
- vs Bottom 5 defense: +15% to projection
- vs Bottom 10 defense: +10%
- vs Top 10 defense: -10%
- vs Top 5 defense: -15%

Prop_Edge = (Player_Projection - Prop_Line) / Prop_Line
```

**Props Caution:**
- Props have higher variance than main lines
- Max 2.0 units on any single prop (capped)
- Don't overload on props from same game (correlated)
- Injury news can destroy prop value (monitor)

---

## FUND 2: CONTRA FUND

### 3.2.1 Philosophy
The betting public is systematically biased. They overbet favorites, overs, popular teams, and primetime games. When public betting reaches extreme levels, historically profitable to fade.

### 3.2.2 Sport-Specific Contrarian Thresholds

| Sport | Trigger Threshold | Why Different |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|
| NFL/NCAAF | 65%+ public | Most public money, lower threshold needed |
| NBA | 70%+ public | Standard threshold |
| NCAAB/NHL | 75%+ public | Less public attention, need more extreme |

### 3.2.3 Data Requirements (Action Network Pro)

| Data | Action Network Location | Required |
|------|-------------------------|----------|
| Public Ticket % | Public Betting → % OF BETS | Yes |
| Public Money % | Public Betting → % OF MONEY | Yes |
| Money-Ticket Divergence | Public Betting → DIFF | Yes |
| Current Line | PRO Report → BEST ODDS | Yes |
| Opening Line | PRO Report → OPEN | Context |

**Quick Find: "Most Lopsided Bets" section on PRO Dashboard**
- Shows games with extreme public % instantly
- Example from screenshot: 98% CARK, 96% LEH, 91% UNT

### 3.2.4 The Contrarian Formula (Simplified with Action Network)

**Step 1: Find Lopsided Games (Sport-Specific)**
```
Use Action Network "Most Lopsided Bets" OR scan Public Betting page

NFL/NCAAF Triggers:
- 65-70% public: Moderate lean → Consider fade
- 70-75% public: Heavy lean → Fade
- 75%+ public: Extreme lean → Strong fade

NBA Triggers:
- 70-75% public: Moderate lean → Consider fade
- 75-80% public: Heavy lean → Fade
- 80%+ public: Extreme lean → Strong fade

NCAAB/NHL Triggers:
- 75-80% public: Moderate lean → Consider fade
- 80-85% public: Heavy lean → Fade
- 85%+ public: Extreme lean → Strong fade
```

**Step 2: Check Money Divergence (DIFF column)**
```
DIFF = MONEY % - BET %

Interpretation:
- DIFF negative (money < bets): Sharp money on OTHER side → STRONG signal
- DIFF positive (money > bets): Money confirms public → WEAKER signal
- DIFF near zero: Neutral → Standard fade

Example from screenshot - Cowboys:
- 69% bets on Cowboys
- 86% money on Cowboys
- DIFF = +17% (money CONFIRMS public)
- Weaker contrarian signal on Giants
```

**Step 3: Contrarian Score Formula**
```
Contrarian_Score = (BET% - Threshold) + (DIFF_Bonus)

DIFF_Bonus:
- If DIFF < 0 (money diverges): Add |DIFF| × 2
- If DIFF > 0 (money confirms): Subtract DIFF × 1

Examples (NFL with 65% threshold):
- 80% bets, -15% DIFF: Score = 15 + 30 = 45 (STRONG)
- 75% bets, +5% DIFF: Score = 10 - 5 = 5 (WEAK)
- 70% bets, -10% DIFF: Score = 5 + 20 = 25 (GOOD)
```

### 3.2.5 Contra Fund Decision Matrix

| BET % (above threshold) | DIFF | Signal Strength | Units |
|-------------------------|------|-----------------|-------|
| 0-5% above | Positive (confirms) | Weak | 0.5-1.0 |
| 0-5% above | Negative (diverges) | Moderate | 1.0-1.5 |
| 5-10% above | Positive (confirms) | Moderate | 1.0-1.5 |
| 5-10% above | Negative (diverges) | Strong | 1.5-2.0 |
| 10%+ above | Any | Strong/Max | 2.0-3.0 |

### 3.2.6 Contrarian Boosts & Cautions

**Add conviction (+0.5 units) when:**
- Primetime game (public loves overs/favorites)
- Popular team is public side (Cowboys, Lakers, etc.)
- Team on winning streak (recency bias)
- Large spread (public loves big favorites)

**Reduce or pass when:**
- Sharp Action indicator lit on public side → PASS
- PRO Systems triggered on public side → Caution
- Public side has genuine situational edge → Reduce

---

## FUND 3: SHARP FUND

### 3.3.1 Philosophy
Professional bettors have better information and models. They move lines. Action Network Pro identifies sharp money for us via indicators. We follow the smart money.

### 3.3.2 Data Requirements (Action Network Pro)

| Data | Action Network Location | Required |
|------|-------------------------|----------|
| Sharp Action Indicator | PRO Report → SHARP ACTION (blue = signal) | YES |
| Big Money Indicator | PRO Report → BIG MONEY (blue = signal) | YES |
| Opening Line | PRO Report → OPEN | Yes |
| Current Line | PRO Report → BEST ODDS | Yes |
| Public Ticket % | PRO Report → BETS | Yes |
| Public Money % | PRO Report → $ | Yes |
| Money-Ticket Divergence | Public Betting → DIFF | Yes |

**Important: Click each game row in PRO Report to see popup with signal explanations**

### 3.3.3 Sharp Signal Detection (Simplified with Action Network)

**Signal 1: Action Network Sharp Action Indicator**
```
SHARP_ACTION = Blue indicator lit in PRO Report

This is Action Network's pre-calculated sharp money detection.
When lit, professional money has been identified on that side.
```

**Signal 2: Action Network Big Money Indicator**
```
BIG_MONEY = Blue indicator lit in PRO Report

Large dollar amounts coming in on one side.
Often correlates with sharp action.
```

**Signal 3: Money vs Ticket Divergence (DIFF)**
```
DIFF = MONEY % - BET %

Sharp Signal when:
- BET % on Side A is 65%+
- BUT MONEY % on Side A is lower (negative DIFF)
- Sharps are betting bigger on Side B

Example from screenshots:
- Clippers: 26% bets, 42% money
- DIFF on Clippers: +16%
- Sharps putting bigger bets on Clippers despite public on Lakers
```

**Signal 4: Reverse Line Movement (RLM)**
```
RLM = Line moves OPPOSITE of public betting

Detect by comparing:
- OPEN line vs Current line (CONS/BEST ODDS)
- Direction of public betting

If public is 70% on Team A but line moved toward Team B:
- Sharp money on Team B moved the line
- RLM confirmed
```

### 3.3.4 The Sharp Score Formula

```
Sharp_Score =
  (AN_Sharp_Action × 3) +     // 3 points if lit
  (AN_BigMoney × 2) +         // 2 points if lit
  (DIFF_Points) +             // 0-3 points based on divergence
  (RLM_Points)                // 0-2 points if detected

DIFF_Points (when DIFF favors opposite of public):
- |DIFF| < 5%: 0 points
- |DIFF| 5-10%: 1 point
- |DIFF| 10-15%: 2 points
- |DIFF| 15%+: 3 points

RLM_Points:
- No RLM: 0 points
- Weak RLM (0.5-1 point move): 1 point
- Strong RLM (1+ point move): 2 points
```

### 3.3.5 SharpFund Decision Matrix

| Sharp Score | Signal Quality | Units |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| 0-2 | No sharp signal | PASS |
| 3-4 | Weak signal (maybe AN Sharp OR divergence) | 0.5-1.0 |
| 5-6 | Moderate (AN Sharp + some divergence) | 1.0-1.5 |
| 7-8 | Strong (AN Sharp + Big Money + divergence) | 1.5-2.0 |
| 9+ | Very strong (all signals aligned) | 2.0-3.0 |

### 3.3.6 SharpFund Examples (From Screenshots)

**Example 1: Clippers +6.5 (Strong Signal)**
- SHARP ACTION: ✓ Lit (blue)
- BIG MONEY: ✓ Lit (blue)
- BET %: 26% on Clippers (public on Lakers)
- MONEY %: 42% on Clippers
- DIFF: +16% (money diverging toward Clippers)
- Line Move: Opened -1.5, now +6.5 (massive move)

**Sharp Score:**
- AN Sharp: 3 points
- AN Big Money: 2 points
- DIFF (16%): 3 points
- RLM: 2 points (massive move opposite public)
- **Total: 10 → MAX CONVICTION BET on Clippers +6.5**

**Example 2: Wizards +10.5 (Moderate Signal)**
- SHARP ACTION: ✓ Lit
- BIG MONEY: Not lit
- BET %: 34% on Wizards
- MONEY %: 36% on Wizards
- DIFF: +2% (minimal divergence)

**Sharp Score:**
- AN Sharp: 3 points
- AN Big Money: 0 points

## FUND 4: CATALYST FUND

### 3.4.1 Philosophy
Certain game situations have historically been mispriced by the market. Action Network's PRO Systems identify some of these (High Winds, Road Dog Low Total, etc.). We add our own situational research for edges they don't capture.

### 3.4.2 Data Requirements

**From Action Network Pro:**
| Data | Location | Usage |
|------|----------|-------|
| PRO Systems Triggers | PRO Report → PRO SYSTEMS | Backtested situations |
| Current Line | PRO Report → BEST ODDS | Bet placement |
| My Systems | Dashboard → My Systems | Active triggers |

**PRO Systems to Follow (Documented Winners):**
| System | Record | Win % | ROI |
|--------|--------|-------|-----|
| High Winds (PRO) | 613-455-10 | 57% | +11% |
| Divisional Unders (PRO) | 188-136-5 | 58% | +15% |
| Road Dog Low Total (PRO) | 394-287-16 | 58% | +13% |
| Reverse Line Movement Unders | 479-392-8 | 55% | +7% |

**From Web Search (Situations AN doesn't cover):**
| Data | Source | Required |
|------|--------|----------|
| Team schedule (rest days) | ESPN, NBA.com | Yes |
| Travel information | Calculate from schedule | Yes |
| Previous matchup results | ESPN | For revenge |
| Playoff/standings context | ESPN standings | For motivation |
| Weather forecast | Weather.com | For outdoor |
| Injury report | ESPN, team sites | Yes |

### 3.4.3 Evidence-Based Situation Tiers

**TIER 1: PROVEN EDGES (Full Points)**
These situations have documented, backtested evidence of profitability.

| Situation | Points | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| 2+ days rest vs B2B | +3 | Documented in NBA betting research |
| PRO Systems trigger (High Winds, etc.) | +3 | 55-58% win rate, 10%+ ROI |
| Cross-country travel (3+ time zones) | +2 | For home team |
| Off bye week (NFL) | +2 | Rest + preparation edge |
| Home underdog (NFL) | +2 | Historically profitable |

**TIER 2: LIKELY EDGES (×0.75 multiplier)**
Strong logic and some evidence, but less documented.

| Situation | Base Points | Adjusted |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| 3rd road game in 4 nights | 3 | 2.25 |
| Altitude game (Denver, Utah) | 2 | 1.5 |
| Divisional underdog | 2 | 1.5 |
| Playoff implications for one team only | 2 | 1.5 |
| Short week (Thursday game) | 2 | 1.5 |

**TIER 3: NARRATIVE EDGES (×0.50 multiplier)**
Logical but less proven. May be priced in or overrated.

| Situation | Base Points | Adjusted |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Revenge game (lost by 15+ last meeting) | 3 | 1.5 |
| Facing former team (star traded) | 2 | 1.0 |
| Letdown spot (after big win) | 2 | 1.0 |
| Lookahead spot (big game next) | 2 | 1.0 |
| Sandwich game (between marquee games) | 2 | 1.0 |

**WEATHER (Outdoor Games - Tier 1 Proven):**
| Situation | Points | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Wind 15+ mph | +2 (for under) | Affects passing/kicking |
| Wind 20+ mph | +3 (for under) | Strong wind impact |
| Cold (<32°F) | +1 (for under) | Ball handling affected |
| Rain/snow | +2 (for under) | Slippery conditions |

### 3.4.4 The Situational Score Formula

```
Situational_Score = Sum of all applicable situation points (with tier multipliers)

For Spreads:
- Positive points for Team A = Bet Team A spread

For Totals:
- Weather/pace points = Bet Under
- High-scoring teams, bad defense = Bet Over
```

### 3.4.5 Catalyst Fund Decision Matrix

| Situational Score | Quality | Units |
|-------------------|---------|-------|
| 0-1.5 | No significant edge | PASS |
| 1.5-3 | Minor situational edge | 0.5-1.0 |
| 3-5 | Moderate situational edge | 1.0-1.5 |
| 5-7 | Strong situational edge | 1.5-2.0 |
| 7+ | Major situational edge | 2.0-3.0 |

### 3.4.6 Catalyst Fund Example

**Game: Celtics at Heat (Thursday)**

**Situation Analysis:**
- Celtics played last night (B2B): Tier 1 = +3 for Heat
- Heat have 2 days rest: (included above)
- Celtics traveled from Boston to Miami: Tier 1 = +2 for Heat
- Last meeting: Heat lost by 22: Tier 3 = +3 × 0.5 = +1.5 for Heat
- Heat fighting for playoff spot, Celtics locked in: Tier 2 = +2 × 0.75 = +1.5 for Heat

**Total Situational Score for Heat: 3 + 2 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 8 points**

**Action: BET HEAT +3.5, Max units (2.0-3.0)**

# SECTION 4: PLAYER PROPS ARCHITECTURE

## 4.1 Props Strategy Overview

**Props belong to VectorFund.** Action Network Pro provides prop projections with calculated edges.

Props are analyzed using the same Quant methodology:
- Compare projection to line
- Calculate edge %
- Apply higher thresholds (props have more variance)

## 4.2 Props Data Requirements

| Data | Source | Method |
|------|--------|--------|
| AN Prop Projections | Action Network Pro | Cmd+A copy/paste |
| Prop lines (all books) | Odds API | API call |
| Player season averages | Web Search (ESPN, Basketball-Ref) | Research |
| Player last 5-10 games | Web Search | Research |
| Matchup defensive rankings | Web Search (TeamRankings) | Research |
| Injury impact (usage changes) | Web Search | Research |

## 4.3 Props Decision Matrix (Action Network Edge)

| AN Edge % | Action | Units |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| < 12% | PASS | 0 |
| 12-20% | Consider | 0.5-1.0 |
| 20-30% | Bet | 1.0-1.5 |
| 30%+ | Strong | 1.5-2.0 (cap) |

## 4.4 Manual Quant Props Formula

When Action Network doesn't have prop data:

```
Base_Projection = (Season_Avg × 0.5) + (Last_5_Avg × 0.3) + (Last_3_Avg × 0.2)

Matchup_Multiplier:
- vs Bottom 5 defense at stat: 1.15
- vs Bottom 10 defense: 1.10
- vs Average defense: 1.00
- vs Top 10 defense: 0.90
- vs Top 5 defense: 0.85

Minutes_Adjustment:
If expected minutes differ from average:
Adjusted_Projection = Base_Projection × (Expected_Minutes / Average_Minutes)

Final_Projection = Base_Projection × Matchup_Multiplier × Minutes_Adjustment

Edge = (Final_Projection - Prop_Line) / Prop_Line
```

## 4.5 Props Caution

- Props have higher variance than main lines
- Max 2.0 units on any single prop (capped)
- Don't overload on props from same game (correlated)
- Injury news can destroy prop value (monitor)

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DAILY ANALYSIS - November 26, 2025
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

VECTOR FUND:
-----------
1. WIZARDS +10.5 @ -105 (DraftKings) - 2.5u

   ACTION NETWORK DATA:
   • PRO LINE: +7.1
   • CONSENSUS: +10.5
   • EDGE: +8.5%
   • GRADE: A-

   PROBABILITY ANALYSIS:
   • Implied Probability (market): 51.2% (at -105)
   • Estimated True Probability: 55.8% (based on +7.1 projection)
   • Edge: 55.8% - 51.2% = +4.6%

   EV CALCULATION:
   • Decimal Odds: 1.952
   • EV% = (0.558 × 1.952) - 1 = +8.9%

   KELLY SIZING:
   • Full Kelly: (0.952 × 0.558 - 0.442) / 0.952 = 9.4%
   • Quarter Kelly: 9.4% × 0.25 = 2.35% → 2.5 units

   REASONING: AN model projects Wizards as +7.1, getting +10.5 is 3.4 points
   of value. Grade A- indicates strong model confidence. No conflicting
   situational factors.

2. DRUMMOND OVER 10.5 PTS @ -130 - 1.5u

   ACTION NETWORK PROP DATA:
   • Projection: 14.43 points
   • Line: 10.5
   • EDGE: +28.6%

   PROBABILITY ANALYSIS:
   • Implied Probability: 56.5% (at -130)
   • Estimated True Probability: 72% (based on 14.43 projection)

   EV CALCULATION:
   • Decimal Odds: 1.769
   • EV% = (0.72 × 1.769) - 1 = +27.4%

   KELLY SIZING:
   • Full Kelly: 27.8%
   • Quarter Kelly: 6.95% → capped at 2.0u for props, using 1.5u

   REASONING: Massive edge on Drummond points. Projection well above line.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

CONTRA FUND:
----------------
1. GIANTS +3.5 @ -110 (FanDuel) - 1.0u

   PUBLIC BETTING DATA:
   • Public Bets: 69% on Cowboys
   • Public Money: 86% on Cowboys
   • DIFF: +17% (money confirms, weaker signal)
   • Threshold: 65% (NFL)

   CONTRARIAN SCORE:
   • Base: 69% - 65% = 4 points
   • DIFF Penalty: -17 × 1 = -17 points
   • ADJUSTED SCORE: -13 (normally weak, but...)

   ADDITIONAL FACTORS:
   • Popular team (Cowboys): +5 points
   • Primetime game: +5 points
   • FINAL SCORE: -3 → Weak signal, minimum sizing

   REASONING: Cowboys have heavy public AND money support. Normally too
   much confirmation, but Cowboys tax (popular team) adds value. Minimum
   sizing due to weak score.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SHARP FUND:
-----------
1. CLIPPERS +6.5 @ -108 (Caesars) - 3.0u

   SHARP SIGNALS:
   • Sharp Action: ✓ LIT
   • Big Money: ✓ LIT
   • Line Move: -1.5 → +6.5 (8 point move!)

   PUBLIC DATA:
   • Public Bets: 26% on Clippers
   • Public Money: 42% on Clippers
   • DIFF: +16%

   SHARP SCORE CALCULATION:
   • AN Sharp Action: 3 points
   • AN Big Money: 2 points
   • DIFF (16%): 3 points
   • RLM (8 pt move opposite public): 2 points
   • TOTAL: 10 points → MAX CONVICTION

   REASONING: All sharp indicators firing. Line moved 8 points AWAY from
   public. Classic sharp money pattern. Maximum conviction play.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

CATALYST FUND:
-----------------
1. SAINTS +6 @ -110 (BetMGM) - 2.0u

   PRO SYSTEMS:
   • Road Dog Low Total After Bad Season (PRO): ✓ TRIGGERED
   • System Record: 394-287-16 (58% win, +13% ROI)

   SITUATIONAL FACTORS:
   • Tier 1: PRO System trigger = +3 points
   • Tier 1: Home underdog = +2 points
   • Tier 2: Divisional game = +2 × 0.75 = +1.5 points

   TOTAL SITUATIONAL SCORE: 6.5 points → Strong

   UNIT SIZING: 6.5 → 1.5-2.0 units (using 2.0)

   REASONING: PRO System with documented 13% ROI triggering. Additional
   situational factors confirm.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DAILY SUMMARY:
--------------
• Total Picks: 5
• Total Units: 10.0

FUND BREAKDOWN:
• VectorFund: 4.0u (2 picks: Wizards spread, Drummond prop)
• ContraFund: 1.0u (1 pick: Giants)
• SharpFund: 3.0u (1 pick: Clippers)
• CatalystFund: 2.0u (1 pick: Saints)

CONFLICTING POSITIONS: None today
(If funds had opposite sides, both would be listed with note)

CLV = (Our_Odds - Closing_Odds) for moneylines

If we bet Thunder -5.5 and it closed at -6.5:
CLV = 1 point of value captured (good!)

Long-term: If we consistently beat closing lines, we have edge
```
