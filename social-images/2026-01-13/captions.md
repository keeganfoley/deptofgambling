## THE ANALYSIS (Instagram Pinned Comment)

THE ANALYSIS 📊

NCAAB 🏀
    ⁃    Indiana +6.5 — Sharp divergence play. 59% of bets on Michigan State but 51% of money on Indiana. When the public bets one way but the money goes the other, follow the money. Big Ten road dogs historically profitable.

NBA 🏀
    ⁃    Spurs +8.5 — Sharp Action + Big Money both lit. Line opened at +7.5 and moved TO +8.5 in our favor. When sharps bet an underdog and the line moves away from them, that's a gift. Wemby keeps games competitive.

NHL 🏒
    ⁃    Predators ML — 41% of bets but 55% of money backing Nashville at home. Classic sharp vs public split. Oilers on second leg of back-to-back. Home ice advantage.
    ⁃    Stars ML — Sharp Action + Big Money on Dallas. Anaheim is 0-9 in their last 9 games. Stars are road warriors. Laying -120 on a team playing the worst team in hockey.
