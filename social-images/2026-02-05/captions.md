## THE ANALYSIS (Instagram Pinned Comment)

```
THE ANALYSIS

NBA
    -    Mavericks +8.5 — Anchor of the card. Projection model has this at Spurs -3.5, a full 5 points tighter than the market's 8. San Antonio on a back-to-back after beating OKC 116-106. Dallas is gutted by trades but Cooper Flagg has been otherworldly — 31.2 PPG over his last 5 including a 49-point game. B2B fatigue for the Spurs plus Flagg factor at home should keep this closer than 8.5 points. Largest edge on tonight's NBA board. 1.5u Sharp.
    -    Jazz +9.5 — Both teams just went through massive trade deadline overhauls. Jazz acquired Jaren Jackson Jr. and Lonzo Ball, Hawks traded Porzingis and added Kuminga and Hield. With rosters still gelling and new pieces not yet integrated, the chaos factor favors the points. Model has this at Hawks -6.6, nearly 3 points tighter. 59% of money on Utah despite even bet split confirms sharp divergence. 1u Sharp.
    -    76ers +4 — Only 47% of bets on Philly but 57% of money — a meaningful 10% divergence. Embiid likely to play since this is NOT a back-to-back. Lakers have Luka averaging 33.4 PPG but sharp money says Philly keeps this close. 0.5u Sharp.
    -    Bulls +7.5 — Model projects Raptors -5.6, nearly 2 points tighter than the market. Bulls in full teardown mode after deadline, but the line already moved from -9.5 to -7.5. Toronto without Poeltl and Chris Paul. Tank-mode teams with young guys fighting for roster spots can play hard. 0.5u Vector.

NCAAB
    -    Merrimack -1.5 — Highest-graded NCAAB spread tonight (A- grade, 7.8% edge). Model projects Merrimack by 4.7 in a game lined at just 1.5. They're 10-2 in MAAC play sitting in first place. Won the first meeting 75-58. Kevair Kennedy leads at 17.1 PPG. 0.5u Vector.
    -    N. Florida +6.5 — Model projects a 4.4-point game, 2+ points tighter than the market. Both teams inconsistent but 6.5 feels like too many between two lower-tier ASUN teams. Kamrin Oriol capable of 35-point explosions. 0.5u Vector.
    -    Drexel +4.5 — Drexel's elite defense (65.7 PPG allowed, 22nd nationally) vs Campbell's high-powered offense (80.9 PPG). Model projects a 2.4-point game. B+ grade with 6.8% edge. Drexel's defensive identity should keep this tight. 0.5u Vector.
    -    Morehead St +8.5 — Both teams 8-4 in OVC, tied for 2nd. Morehead has won 5 straight at SE Missouri's gym and 8 of the last 9 in Cape Girardeau. Won the first meeting 71-69. Model projects 6.4 points. 8.5 is too many given the head-to-head dominance. 0.5u Catalyst.
    -    E. Illinois +9.5 — Beat Tennessee State 74-70 in the first meeting on Jan 10. TSU just lost to Tennessee Tech 90-85 shooting 6-24 from three. EIU's defensive identity (70.2 PPG allowed, 82nd nationally) and the first-meeting result suggest 9.5 is generous cushion. 0.5u Catalyst.

NHL
    -    Senators ML — Triple convergence: professional bettor activity, significant money flow, and top expert alignment. Ottawa on a 4-game win streak, 2-0 against Philly this season. Ullmark has been lights-out — .962 SV% in his comeback start. Ottawa ranks 4th in Corsi For % and 1st in expected goals % at 5v5. A regulation win puts playoff odds at 42.1% heading into Olympic break. Maximum motivation. 1u Sharp.
    -    Kings ML — Only 18% of bets but 38% of money — a 20% divergence, largest on tonight's NHL board. Panarin won't play tonight (learning systems). Kings goal-starved at 2.4 GPG but at +114 the risk-reward is right for a Pacific Division rival. 0.5u Catalyst.
    -    Predators ML — Classic sharp fade. Only 8% of bets but 20% of money. Nashville on B2B with backup Annunen in net and Washington rested with Thompson potentially returning. Higher risk but +140 prices in the B2B. 0.5u Contra.
    -    Panthers ML — 94% of public on Tampa Bay but professional money supports Florida at +160. Panthers on B2B and decimated by injuries — Barkov (IR), Seth Jones (IR), Bobrovsky in freefall. High-risk, high-reward rivalry spot. 0.5u Contra.

Mavs +8.5 is the play. Let's work.
