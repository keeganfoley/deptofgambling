💡 This system has been our best performer over the last month. The Lakers are finishing their 8-game Grammy road trip and just lost to the Knicks 112-100. Austin Reaves has been sidelined for 17+ games with a calf strain, LeBron has played every game with no rest, and Brooklyn at home gets 7.5 points of cushion against a road-weary team. When Catalyst NBA spreads speaks, we listen.
