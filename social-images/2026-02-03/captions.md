## THE ANALYSIS (Instagram Pinned Comment)

```
THE ANALYSIS 📊

NHL 🏒
    ⁃    Senators ML x3 — Anchor of the card. Three funds independently qualified. Brady Tkachuk returns tonight, a massive lineup upgrade the market hasn't fully priced in. Professional money backing Ottawa despite 70%+ of tickets on Carolina at home. The line has softened from -175 to -165 as sharp action flows to the Senators. Classic reverse line movement plus a key player return. 3.5u total across Sharp, Contra, Catalyst.
    ⁃    Leafs ML x2 — Leon Draisaitl is on a leave of absence, removing one of the most dangerous players in hockey. The public is still hammering Edmonton at home but the money tells a different story. Toronto getting plus money against a significantly weakened Oilers squad is mispriced. 2.5u across Sharp, Contra.

NCAAB 🏀
    ⁃    La Salle +3 x2 — Second biggest play of the day. Loyola Chicago has lost 9 straight games and ranks near the bottom of KenPom. Our model projects this as a toss-up — getting 3 points against a team in freefall is significant value. Sharp money backing La Salle confirms it. 3.25u across Sharp, Vector.
    ⁃    W. Michigan +10.5 — Model projects this game within 6 points. Getting double digits in a MAC game where the model sees a single-digit margin. Ohio's defensive vulnerabilities match WMU's pace.
    ⁃    St. Bona +7.5 — Professional money moving toward St. Bonaventure at Dayton. The money-ticket divergence signals sharp interest. Getting a full week's worth of points in an A-10 road game.

NBA 🏀
    ⁃    Nets +7.5 x2 — Lakers on game 8 of the Grammy road trip. Over 70% of public tickets on LA but money split 50/50. Extended road trips are one of the most reliable situational fades in the NBA. Brooklyn at home with 7.5 points. 1.5u across Contra, Catalyst.
    ⁃    Magic +9.5 — Model projects a tighter game against OKC. Orlando's defensive identity keeps games low-scoring and close, making double-digit spreads tough to cover.

Senators x3 is the play. Let's work.
