## THE ANALYSIS (Instagram Pinned Comment)

```
THE ANALYSIS

NFL — SUPER BOWL LX
    -    Seahawks -4.5 — Top Experts active on Seattle. The Seahawks own the best ATS record in football at 14-5 and are riding a 9-game win streak into the Super Bowl. Seattle's defense is #1 in the NFL — 17.2 PPG allowed and 285.6 yards per game. New England's offense averaged 28.8 PPG in the regular season but managed only 18 PPG through three playoff rounds. Pro Line projects -4.8, right on the number. Seattle's defense controls the tempo and holds NE under 20. 1u Sharp.
    -    Super Bowl Under 45.5 — The most loaded signal on the entire board. Four indicators converging: Sharp Action, Big Money, Model Projection, and Top Experts ALL on the Under. 32% of bets but 42% of money — a +10% divergence. Seattle's #1 defense (17.2 PPG allowed) vs a Patriots offense that scored just 18 PPG in the playoffs. The total already moved from 45.5 to 45 at some books. Four of five possible indicators aligned on one side is extraordinarily rare. Biggest play of the day. 2u Sharp.

NCAAB
    -    UCF +4.5 — Signal convergence city. Sharp Action and Model Projection both active on the spread (B grade, 4.9% edge, model projects +2.8). On the moneyline, Big Money and Model Projection also fire — 32% of bets on UCF ML but 61% of the money, a 29% divergence that is the largest on the NCAAB slate. UCF is 17-5 overall and 6-4 in the Big 12. Cincinnati is 11-12 and 3-7. The better team is getting 4.5 points on the road. 1.5u Sharp.
    -    UCF ML — Piggybacking the spread with a plus-money sprinkle. 68% of public bets on Cincinnati ML but the handle says UCF. At +176 this only needs to hit ~37% of the time to be profitable. Classic contra play fading the public side at value odds. 0.5u Contra.
    -    Wichita St / Tulane Under 149.5 — Highest-graded total on the NCAAB board. A grade with 8.7% edge. Sharp Action and Pro Systems both active. Model projects the total at 144.1 — a full 5.4 points below the market consensus. Three indicators aligning on a total with this large a model gap. 1u Catalyst.

NBA
    -    Clippers +9.5 — Model Projection active. A grade with 9.8% edge, highest-graded NBA spread today. Pro Line projects +5.4, meaning the market overshot by 4+ points. Garland (toe) is out and Beal is done for the season, but Beal has been priced in for weeks. The line moved from +6.5 to +9.5 — an overreaction. Minnesota isn't a blowout team. 1u Vector.
    -    Pacers +9.5 — Model Projection active. A- grade with 8% edge. Pro Line projects +6.4. Haliburton (Achilles) is a massive loss but the line already moved from +6.5 to +9.5 to account for it. Zubac and Kobe Brown acquired but won't debut today. Toronto is 22-30 — they don't blow teams out. 9.5 is generous. 1u Vector.

SB Under 45.5 is the play. Let's work.
