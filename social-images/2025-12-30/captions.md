THE ANALYSIS

NCAAF (Bowl Games)
    -    Illinois +3 — Tennessee overvalued. Illinois defense travels, Bret Bielema bowl game prep is elite. Getting points in a coin flip.
    -    USC -4 — Trojans motivated, TCU limping into this one. USC's offense too much, covers the short spread.

NBA
    -    76ers ML — Philly at plus money against Memphis. Embiid revenge game, value at +102.
    -    Jazz +8.5 (2u across funds) — Boston on the road, Utah keeps it competitive at home. Big number to cover.

NCAAB
    -    Seton Hall -1 — Pirates catching Marquette at the right time. Road favorite with edge, take the point.

NHL
    -    Hurricanes -1.5 — Carolina dominant at home, Pittsburgh struggling. Canes win by 2+ at plus money value.
