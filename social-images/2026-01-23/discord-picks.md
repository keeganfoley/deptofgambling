1️⃣ PICK 1

🏒 Golden Knights vs Maple Leafs

🎯 GOLDEN KNIGHTS ML @ -118 🎯

🟢 Sharp | NHL | 1u
🕐 7:00 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Sharp NHL: 39-43 (47.6%)
• NHL moneylines: 40-43 (48.2%)
• Sharp Overall: 130-105 (55.3%)

💡 The revenge game narrative is real tonight — Mitch Marner returns to Toronto for the first time since being traded to Vegas on July 1st. Jack Eichel has points in 15 of his last 16 games with 27 points total. Mark Stone just set a franchise record with a 13-game point streak. In the last meeting, Eichel had a 4-point night and scored the OT winner. Vegas has won 3 straight against Toronto including a 6-5 thriller. The Leafs are coming off back-to-back losses including an OT defeat to Detroit. Sharp money aligned on the road favorite in a revenge spot.

2️⃣ PICK 2

🏀 Rockets vs Pistons

🎯 ROCKETS +4.5 @ -112 🎯

⚪ Vector | NBA | 1u
🕐 7:00 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Vector NBA: 57-47 (54.8%)
• NBA spreads: 87-55 (61.3%)
• Vector Overall: 114-104 (52.3%)

💡 Detroit is 32-10 and 18-4 at home — they're legit. But this line opened at +3 and has ballooned to +4.5 with sharp action pushing it toward Houston. The public is split 50/50 on this game, yet the line keeps moving in the Rockets' favor. Alperen Sengun is a matchup problem averaging 21.3 PPG, 9.2 RPG, and 6.4 APG. Cade Cunningham is questionable with an illness after missing Wednesday's game. Getting 4.5 points feels like too many when the best player on the floor might not be 100%.

3️⃣ PICK 3

🏀 Suns vs Hawks

🎯 HAWKS +3.5 @ -112 🎯

🟠 Contra | NBA | 1.5u
🕐 7:30 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Contra NBA: 11-1 (91.7%)
• NBA spreads: 87-55 (61.3%)
• Contra Overall: 23-16 (59.0%)

💡 Jalen Johnson has emerged as a legit star — he just dropped 32 points and 15 rebounds on Memphis. Nickeil Alexander-Walker is averaging 20.5 PPG, and Onyeka Okongwu adds 16.1 and 8 boards nightly. Phoenix is riding a 3-game win streak but they're 13-12 on the road. Only 34% of public bets are on Atlanta, but 39% of the money is — that 5% differential signals sharp action. Atlanta won the first meeting 124-122 in November with Okongwu dropping 27 points. Getting the home team as a dog with sharp money behind them.

4️⃣ PICK 4

🏀 Celtics vs Nets

🎯 NETS +8.5 @ -125 🎯

🟢 Sharp | NBA | 1.5u
🕐 7:30 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Sharp NBA: 26-19 (57.8%)
• NBA spreads: 87-55 (61.3%)
• Sharp Overall: 130-105 (55.3%)

💡 Jayson Tatum is OUT with an achilles injury. Derrick White is also OUT. That's Boston's two best perimeter players gone. Jaylen Brown is balling at 29.8 PPG with 25+ in 9 of his last 10 games, but he's carrying a massive load. The Nets got obliterated 120-66 by the Knicks on Wednesday — the public sees that and is piling on Boston at 78%. But only 75% of the money is there. Sharp action confirmed on Brooklyn. The model projection also favors the Nets. This number should be closer to -6 with those injuries.

5️⃣ PICK 5

🏀 Celtics vs Nets

🎯 NETS +8.5 @ -125 🎯

🟠 Contra | NBA | 1u
🕐 7:30 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Contra NBA: 11-1 (91.7%)
• NBA spreads: 87-55 (61.3%)
• Contra Overall: 23-16 (59.0%)

💡 Double-dipping on this line from the Contra fund as well. 78% of public bets are on Boston but only 75% of money — classic reverse line movement scenario. The public is overreacting to Brooklyn's blowout loss to the Knicks and underreacting to Boston's injury situation. Without Tatum and White, the Celtics offense becomes predictable and Brown has to do everything. Brooklyn has nothing to lose and plays loose in these spots. Two funds aligned on the same number.

6️⃣ PICK 6

🏒 Blues vs Stars

🎯 BLUES ML @ +140 🎯

🔵 Catalyst | NHL | 1u
🕐 8:00 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Catalyst NHL: 9-6 (60.0%)
• NHL moneylines: 40-43 (48.2%)
• Catalyst Overall: 33-21 (61.1%)

💡 St. Louis is 7-14-3 on the road and just got outscored 8-1 by Edmonton and Winnipeg. So why are we here? Because only 10% of tickets are on the Blues, but 17% of the money is — that's sharp money at plus money. The Blues won the first meeting this season. Jordan Kyrou leads the team with 3 points in 4 career games against Dallas. Dallas just got shutout 1-0 by Columbus at home. The Stars are 12-8-2 at home, not the fortress they used to be. Sharp money hunting value at +140.

🏀 Pelicans vs Grizzlies

🎯 PELICANS +6 @ -113 🎯

🟢 Sharp | NBA | 2u
🕐 8:00 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Sharp NBA: 26-19 (57.8%)
• NBA spreads: 87-55 (61.3%)
• Sharp Overall: 130-105 (55.3%)

💡 JA MORANT IS OUT with a UCL sprain in his elbow. Also missing: Santi Aldama, Brandon Clarke, Zach Edey, Ty Jerome, and Scotty Pippen Jr. Memphis is running a skeleton crew. This line opened at Grizzlies -3.5 and has moved to -5.5/-6 because the public sees Memphis at home. But sharps are hammering the Pelicans — sharp action AND model projection both favor New Orleans. Zion Williamson is expected to play. The Grizzlies have lost 8 of 11 without Morant. Getting 6 points against a depleted team is the best value on the board tonight.

8️⃣ PICK 8

🏀 Pacers vs Thunder

🎯 PACERS +15.5 @ -105 🎯

🟢 Sharp | NBA | 1.5u
🕐 8:00 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Sharp NBA: 26-19 (57.8%)
• NBA spreads: 87-55 (61.3%)
• Sharp Overall: 130-105 (55.3%)

💡 Yes, the Thunder are the defending champs and SGA is an MVP candidate. Yes, Tyrese Haliburton is out. But 15.5 points is a massive spread. OKC just finished a 4-game road trip and is playing their first home game in 10 days. Pascal Siakam has stepped into the void and is playing excellent basketball. Sharp action AND model projection both favor Indiana here. The Thunder have covered only 29 of their last 45 home games. This feels like a letdown spot for OKC after grinding through a road trip.

9️⃣ PICK 9

🏒 Capitals vs Flames

🎯 CAPITALS ML @ -130 🎯

🟢 Sharp | NHL | 1u
🕐 9:00 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Sharp NHL: 39-43 (47.6%)
• NHL moneylines: 40-43 (48.2%)
• Sharp Overall: 130-105 (55.3%)

💡 Alex Ovechkin just hit 20 goals for the 21st consecutive season and is now the NHL's all-time goal leader. Washington has won just 3 of their last 10, but they're still the better team here. Calgary has dropped 2 straight. Sharp action confirmed on Capitals ML. Top experts also favor Washington. The Flames allow the 2nd-fewest goals per home game at 2.42, so this could be tight, but Washington has the star power to steal one on the road. Ovechkin hunting for 1,000 career goals gives this team extra motivation every night.

🔟 PICK 10

🏒 Rangers vs Sharks

🎯 RANGERS ML @ +102 🎯

🔵 Catalyst | NHL | 1u
🕐 10:00 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Catalyst NHL: 9-6 (60.0%)
• NHL moneylines: 40-43 (48.2%)
• Catalyst Overall: 33-21 (61.1%)

💡 The Rangers are 2-7-1 in their last 10, missing star goalie Igor Shesterkin and top defenseman Adam Fox, bleeding 4.4 goals per game. So why back them? Artemi Panarin. He has points in 10 of his last 11 games, 49 points since November 7th which ranks 6th in the NHL. Sharp money is on New York at plus money. The Sharks won the first meeting 6-5 in OT with Macklin Celebrini scoring a hat trick, but San Jose is just 13-9-3 at home. Getting plus money on a team with Panarin rolling feels like value.

1️⃣1️⃣ PICK 11

🏀 Raptors vs Trail Blazers

🎯 TRAIL BLAZERS +4.5 @ -115 🎯

🟢 Sharp | NBA | 1.5u
🕐 10:00 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Sharp NBA: 26-19 (57.8%)
• NBA spreads: 87-55 (61.3%)
• Sharp Overall: 130-105 (55.3%)

💡 Portland is on a 4-game win streak, beating Sacramento, the Lakers, and the Hawks. Deni Avdija is averaging 26.2 PPG and Shaedon Sharpe adds 21.8 nightly. Toronto is 27-19 and 14-9 on the road — they're solid. But sharp action, model projection, AND top experts all favor Portland here. That's a rare trifecta. The public is also on the Blazers at 65%, so for once the sharps and squares agree. When everyone's pointing the same direction with a home team on a win streak, ride the momentum.
