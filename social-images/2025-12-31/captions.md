THE ANALYSIS

NCAAF (Bowl Game)
    -    Iowa +3.5 — Vanderbilt lost All-American TE Eli Stowers to NFL opt-out. Iowa zero opt-outs, fully healthy. Sharp money flowing to the Hawkeyes.

NCAAB
    -    Clemson +1.5 — Elite defense (65.8 PPG allowed). Syracuse star Freeman returning from injury, could be rusty. Clemson won last year's matchup.
    -    Georgetown +9.5 — Line moved from +8.5 to +9.5, sharp money hammering the Hoyas. Big East games stay tight.

NBA
    -    Suns +6.5 — Phoenix riding 4-game win streak. Model projects 3-point game, getting 6.5. Cleveland inconsistent lately.
    -    Knicks ML — 70% money on NY despite 36% bets. Knicks just dropped 130. Spurs missing Vassell, Castle questionable.
    -    Blazers +15.5 — Model projects 8-point game, getting 15.5. NYE letdown spot for OKC, 7+ points of value.

NHL
    -    Wild -1.5 — Minnesota 24-9-4 vs San Jose 11-22-5 (worst in NHL). 88% money on puck line. Plus odds value.
    -    Jets ML — Line moved from -105 to +102 (massive RLM). 82% bets on Detroit but only 47% money. Kane still questionable.

Happy New Year. Let's close out 2024 right.
