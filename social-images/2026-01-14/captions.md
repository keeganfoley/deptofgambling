## THE ANALYSIS (Instagram Pinned Comment)

THE ANALYSIS 📊

NCAAB 🏀
    ⁃    Missouri St +6.5 — Our top play of the day. 50% of bets but 76% of money on Missouri State. That 26% gap means big-money bettors see value. Line moved from +7.5 to +6.5 in our direction. Model projects a 3.7-point game, we're getting 6.5.
    ⁃    Middle Tenn -3.5 — Model projects a 7.4-point win but we're only laying 3.5. That's nearly 4 points of value. Money confirms with 62% of dollars backing Middle Tennessee despite only 49% of tickets.
    ⁃    California +14 — Duke traveling cross-country for an 11 PM EST tip. Late-night West Coast games historically favor the home team. Model sees this closer to a 10-point game. Taking the cushion.

NBA 🏀
    ⁃    Pelicans -1 — Line flipped 3 full points from Nets -1.5 to Pelicans -1. When sharps push a line that hard against a road team on a 4-game skid, follow the money. Home team in a battle of bad teams.
    ⁃    Nuggets +2.5 — Both teams decimated by injuries but Denver still has Murray and MPJ. Dallas running a G-League roster without Kyrie or Luka. Taking the team with remaining star power.
