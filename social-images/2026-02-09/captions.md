## THE ANALYSIS (Instagram Pinned Comment)

```
THE ANALYSIS

NCAAB
    -    Navy -6.5 — Sharp Action active. Navy is 18-6 and rolling through the Patriot League at 10-1. Bucknell is 8-15 and 4-7 in conference. Navy owns the best defense in the Patriot League allowing just 63.2 PPG. Road favorite but the talent gap is massive — Navy's ATS record backs it up. 1u Sharp.
    -    S. Illinois -1.5 — Sharp Action + Model Projection convergence. SIU is 14-10 but 8-5 in MVC play and playing their best ball of the season. Indiana State is 11-13 and 4-9 in conference, losers of 5 of their last 7 at home. Model projects SIU -3.2 with a 4.8% edge. Sharp money moved this from PK to -1.5. 1.25u Sharp.
    -    Belmont -1.5 (Vector) — Consensus play across two funds. Belmont is 22-3 overall and riding a 9-game win streak. They lead the MVC at 12-1 in conference. Model projects -4.1 with a 7.2% edge — the largest model gap on the NCAAB slate. Bradley is 11-13 and 5-8 in MVC play. Belmont's offense is scoring 79+ PPG and they've covered in 7 of their last 9. 1.5u Vector.
    -    Belmont -1.5 (Sharp) — Same game, different fund. Sharp Action firing on Belmont. The money side confirms what the model sees — Belmont is the clear class of the MVC and 1.5 points is a gift. 1u Sharp.

NBA
    -    Hawks +8.5 — Model Projection active. A- grade with 8.1% edge. Pro Line projects +5.2, meaning the market is 3+ points wide. Atlanta has been competitive on the road and Minnesota hasn't been a consistent double-digit blowout team. Trae Young keeps this within range. 2u Vector.
    -    Lakers +7 (Vector) — The centerpiece of tonight's card. OKC is on a back-to-back and SGA is OUT through the All-Star break. Jalen Williams returns but hasn't played since January — expect rust. Lakers are at home with a full roster. Model projects +3.8. The line already moved from -9.5 to -7, and it might not be enough. 1.5u Vector.
    -    Lakers ML (+220) — Sharp money on the Lakers moneyline. Big Money indicator active — 23% of bets but 41% of the handle on LAL ML, an 18% divergence. At +220 this only needs to hit ~31% of the time to print. OKC without SGA on a B2B makes this a live dog at plus-money. 1u Sharp.
    -    Lakers +7 (Catalyst) — Situational angle stacking on top. B2B spot for OKC, star player out, road game. Lakers have covered in 6 of their last 8 home games. Smaller sizing as a satellite position. 0.5u Catalyst.
    -    Grizzlies +9.5 — Model Projection active with a 6.4% edge. Memphis is without Morant and Edey but this line has moved too far — Golden State is also missing Curry, Porzingis, and Butler hasn't debuted. Both teams are depleted. Model projects +5.8 in a sloppy game between two short-handed rosters. 1u Vector.

Belmont consensus + Lakers triple-stack. Let's work.
