## THE ANALYSIS (Instagram Pinned Comment)

```
THE ANALYSIS 📊

NCAAB 🏀
    ⁃    Det. Mercy +6.5 — Anchor of the card. Our model projects Detroit as a 2-3 point underdog in a game the market has at 6.5. Milwaukee has lost 5 of their last 6 and is on a 3-game home losing streak with defensive metrics cratering. Meanwhile Spratt is averaging 22+ in conference play, coming off a 28-point, 8-three explosion. A+ grade with a 12.2% model edge. Getting 6.5 in a game projected much closer is significant cushion. 2u Vector.

NBA 🏀
    ⁃    Rockets -7.5 — Textbook situational mismatch. Boston is on a road back-to-back after playing in Dallas. Jaylen Brown doubtful, Tatum still sidelined with the Achilles, and the roster in flux following the Simons-for-Vučević trade deadline swap. Houston at home with full rest and Kevin Durant probable. Fatigue plus depletion against a patchwork Celtics rotation is worth the big number. 1.5u Catalyst.
    ⁃    Pelicans -4.5 — Milwaukee is gutted. Giannis OUT with the calf, Portis OUT, Prince OUT, Harris OUT. Trade deadline chaos has this roster in disarray. New Orleans at home laying under 5 against a skeleton crew. 1u Catalyst.

NHL 🏒
    ⁃    Flames ML — Battle of Alberta. Edmonton on a back-to-back after a demoralizing 5-2 loss to the Leafs, likely turning to Jarry who has been brutal — .833 SV% over his last 5 starts with a 4.77 GAA. Calgary is rested at home and holds a 2-1 season series edge. Fatigued team, struggling goaltender, rivalry game. Home dog has value. 1u Catalyst.
    ⁃    Red Wings ML — Gibson has been unconscious since December — 18-4-1 with a .925 SV% and 4 shutouts. Sharp indicators aligned on Detroit as a road underdog getting plus money. 0.5u Sharp.
    ⁃    Kraken ML — Seattle owns the season series 2-0 against LA. Sharp money backing the Kraken at +160. Professional indicators pointing to value on the road dog. 0.5u Sharp.

Det. Mercy +6.5 is the play. Let's work.
