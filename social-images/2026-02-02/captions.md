## THE ANALYSIS (Instagram Pinned Comment)

```
THE ANALYSIS 📊

NHL 🏒
    ⁃    Senators ML — Professional money backing Ottawa at home. Washington's goaltending crisis is brutal — Logan Thompson on IR, Charlie Lindgren on IR, forcing Clay Stevenson into just his second career NHL start. Ottawa has won 4 of 5 at home. When you catch a team starting their third-string goalie, you exploit it.
    ⁃    Islanders ML — Same Capitals goaltending angle. Plus-money on the road against a team starting a backup's backup is rare value. Islanders need points in the Metro race. Multiple sharp indicators aligned.
    ⁃    Red Wings ML — 67% of public on St. Louis but money diverging from tickets. Detroit at +165 when the sharps aren't fading is classic contrarian value.

NCAAB 🏀
    ⁃    Kansas +4.5 x3 — Anchor of the card. Three funds independently qualified. Professional money backing the Jayhawks in Lubbock despite 60% of tickets on Tech. Model projects KU within 2 points — getting 4.5 is a 6.8% edge. Bill Self road dogs in Big 12 play cover at a strong rate historically. 4.5u total across Sharp, Vector, Catalyst.
    ⁃    SFA +2.5 — Stephen F. Austin is 11-0 at home, 19-3 overall. Getting 2.5 at home against McNeese in a Southland showdown is too generous for a team that doesn't lose on its own floor.
    ⁃    TAMUCC -4.5 — Model projects a 7-point edge. Laying 4.5 at home against Lamar with a significant efficiency differential the market hasn't priced in.
    ⁃    FAMU +3.5 — Model projects a tight SWAC game. Getting nearly a full possession at home where FAMU has been competitive all year.
    ⁃    B-Cookman -1.5 — 79% of bets on the other side but money split 50/50. Classic fade. Bethune-Cookman at home in a coin-flip SWAC game.

Loaded card. Kansas is the play. Let's work.
