## THE ANALYSIS (Instagram Pinned Comment)

```
THE ANALYSIS 📊

NHL 🏒
    ⁃    Stars ML — Triple-lit (Sharp + Big Money + PRO Systems). Oettinger (.911 SV%) has goaltending edge over Binnington. Stars won last meeting 3-2. Professional money piling on despite road game.
    ⁃    Sharks ML — Triple-lit. Canucks 5-16-3 at home (worst in NHL). Demko out for season (hip surgery), Boeser on IR. Sharks won both meetings (3-2, 6-3). Celebrini has 74 pts (4th NHL).

NCAAB 🏀
    ⁃    W Michigan +1 — A- Grade with 7.9% model edge. Line flipped from WMU -1.5 to +1 (2.5 pt RLM). Model projects WMU -3.3. Big Money and PRO Systems confirm.
    ⁃    G Washington +10.5 — Triple-lit. KenPom shows only 2.4-point efficiency gap, translating to ~9-point spread with home court. Getting +10.5 offers 1.5+ points of value.
    ⁃    Incarnate Word -1.5 — Only 2% of public tickets but Sharp + Big Money lit = textbook stealth play. UIW won first meeting 73-56 (+17).

NBA 🏀
    ⁃    Pelicans +15 — A+ Grade with 12.9% model edge. Thunder missing Jalen Williams, Alex Caruso, Isaiah Hartenstein. Model projects +8.4, getting +15 provides 6.6 pts buffer.
    ⁃    Nets +9 — A Grade with 8.7% model edge. Devin Booker OUT (ankle). Model projected +5.3, getting +9 offers 3.7 pts value. Nets 9-6-1 ATS as road underdogs.

Injury spots + sharp money. Let's work.
