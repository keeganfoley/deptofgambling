## THE ANALYSIS (Instagram Pinned Comment)

```
THE ANALYSIS 📊

NCAAB 🏀
    ⁃    Elon -1.5 — Professional money aligned on Elon as small favorites. Northeastern is decimated by injuries with three players already lost for the season. Elon's offensive firepower (85.4 PPG) should exploit a Huskies team that's 5-11 and lost their last three.

NBA 🏀
    ⁃    Rockets +4.5 — Triple sharp signal: Sharp Action, Big Money, and Top Experts all aligned on Houston at home. Thunder won the last meeting 125-124 in OT. These teams are closer than the spread suggests. Rockets on a 7-game home win streak.
    ⁃    Bucks +7.5 — Model projects this as a 4.9-point game but we're getting 7.5 points. That's 2.6 points of value. Money quietly backing Milwaukee with 55% of dollars despite even ticket split. Too many points against a healthy Giannis.
    ⁃    Hornets +3.5 — Sharp action triggered on Charlotte despite 72% of public on LA. 6% money divergence toward Hornets. Classic fade-the-public spot against a Lakers team everyone loves to back.

NHL 🏒
    ⁃    Kraken ML — Only 11% of bets on Seattle but sharp action detected. Money percentage (19%) diverging from tickets. Kraken beat Boston 7-4 earlier this month. Plus-money value fading the public.
    ⁃    Islanders ML — Public pounding Oilers at 89% but 31% of money on Islanders. That +20% divergence signals sharp interest at plus-money.

Discipline day. Killed multiple A+ plays due to star injuries (Brunson, Booker) already priced in. Taking what the market gives us.
