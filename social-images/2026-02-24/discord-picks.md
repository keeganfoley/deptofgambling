💰 NEW PICKS DROPPED — LET'S RIDE ⚡

📋 Feb 24 | 5 plays across NCAAB & NBA

1️⃣ PICK 1
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🏀 Billikens vs Flyers

🎯 SAINT LOUIS -3.5 @ -104 🎯

⚫ Vector | NCAAB | 1u
⏰ 7:00 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Vector NCAAB: 38-33 (53.5%)
• NCAAB spreads: 101-74 (57.7%)
• Vector Overall: 133-124 (51.8%)

💡 Our model projects Saint Louis -6.6, but the market has this at -3.5 to -5.5 depending on the book. Getting -3.5 means we only need a 4-point win when projections see a 6.6-point margin — that's roughly 2.5 points of line edge. #18 Saint Louis is sitting in 1st place in the A-10 and has been dominant in conference play. Yes, they're 0-5 SU in their last 5 trips to UD Arena, but being 0-5 as a ~5-point favorite means they've been competitive every time — the spread already accounts for Dayton's home court. This is the biggest model-to-market discrepancy on the entire NCAAB board tonight.

2️⃣ PICK 2
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🏀 Knicks vs Cavaliers

🎯 KNICKS +4 @ -105 🎯

⚫ Vector | NBA | 1u
⏰ 7:30 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Vector NBA: 66-55 (54.5%)
• NBA spreads: 111-77 (59.0%)
• Vector Overall: 133-124 (51.8%)

💡 Projections have the Knicks at +2.3, but the market is giving us +4 — 1.7 points of free value. This is the cleanest matchup on the NBA board: the 37-21 Knicks vs the 36-22 Cavaliers, both essentially fully healthy. Getting 4 points with a near-equal road team is generous. Public action is relatively split (46/54 on the spread), meaning this isn't a public-inflated line — the market is just slightly overvaluing Cleveland's home court advantage. Two top-tier teams, and we're getting a full possession of cushion.


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
3️⃣ PICK 3
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🏀 Bulls vs Hornets

🎯 BULLS +8.5 @ -110 🎯

🟢 Sharp | NBA | 1u
⏰ 8:00 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Sharp NBA: 36-30 (54.5%)
• NBA spreads: 111-77 (59.0%)
• Sharp Overall: 166-135 (55.2%)

💡 This one screams sharp money. Projections have Hornets -6.1, but the market has ballooned to -8.5 — that's 2.4 points of off-market value. Here's the tell: 85% of moneyline bets are on Charlotte, but only 43% of the actual money — a massive 42% divergence, the biggest on the entire NBA board tonight. That means the sharp, high-dollar bettors are hammering the Bulls side while the public loads up on Charlotte. The line has moved a full 4 points from -4.5 to -8.5 on pure public money. Chicago is at home with 2 days rest vs Charlotte's 1 day. When public action inflates a line this far past what the numbers say, the correction usually comes on the court.

4️⃣ PICK 4
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🏀 Pelicans vs Warriors

🎯 PELICANS +1.5 @ -109 🎯

🟣 Catalyst | NBA | 1u
⏰ 8:00 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Catalyst NBA: 13-7 (65.0%)
• NBA spreads: 111-77 (59.0%)
• Catalyst Overall: 44-35 (55.7%)

💡 Projections see the Pelicans at +0, essentially a coin flip, but we're getting 1.5 points. The situational spot here is what makes this interesting — New Orleans has been playing better ball lately and Golden State has been inconsistent at home. This is a classic case where the name value of "Warriors at home" is carrying the line further than the actual matchup warrants. 1.5 points of edge on what projects as a pick'em game. We'll take the free points every time.

5️⃣ PICK 5
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🏀 Volunteers vs Tigers

🎯 TENNESSEE -2.5 @ -110 🎯

⚫ Vector | NCAAB | 1u
⏰ 9:00 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Vector NCAAB: 38-33 (53.5%)
• NCAAB spreads: 101-74 (57.7%)
• Vector Overall: 133-124 (51.8%)

💡 Our model projects Tennessee -4.9, but the market has this at just -2.5. That's 2.4 points of line edge on a top-tier SEC team. Tennessee is 20-7 and tied for 2nd in the SEC — this is a legit contender. The line actually moved from -4.5 down to -2.5, meaning the market is overcorrecting for Mizzou Arena's home court advantage. Missouri at 18-9 is solid, but #15 caliber Tennessee being priced as barely a 2.5-point favorite on the road feels like a gift. When the model sees nearly a 5-point win and the market gives you 2.5, you take the discount.

BOL to everyone tailing 🍀
