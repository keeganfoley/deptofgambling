THE BREAKDOWN 📊

NHL 🏒 (0-3)
    •   Oilers -1.5 — Edmonton only won by 1. Needed the puck line, didn't get it.
    •   Red Wings ML — Detroit couldn't close as road dogs.
    •   Golden Knights ML — Vegas laid an egg at home as favorites.

NBA 🏀 (1-2)
    •   76ers +2.5 ✅ — Philly covered easily. Sharp money was right.
    •   Hornets +6.5 — Charlotte got blown out, couldn't stay within the number.
    •   Bulls +9.5 — Chicago couldn't keep it competitive.

NCAAB 🏀 (2-0)
    •   UNC Wilmington +2.5 ✅ — Seahawks covered as dogs. Vector model was spot on.
    •   Southern Indiana -2 ✅ — Screaming Eagles got it done at home. Contra hit.

Bad day but the process continues. See you tomorrow.
