**1️⃣ PICK 1**
———————————————

🏒 Golden Knights vs Bruins

🎯 GOLDEN KNIGHTS ML @ -135 🎯

🟢 Sharp | NHL | 1u
🕐 7:00 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Sharp NHL: 41-32 (56.2%)
• NHL moneylines: 39-33 (54.2%)
• Sharp Overall: 129-101 (56.1%)

💡 Vegas snapped a 7-game win streak Monday but remains the Pacific's best team. The Knights have won 3 straight head-to-head against Boston including a 6-5 thriller at T-Mobile. Jack Eichel and Mark Stone are rolling — Stone has 17 points in his last 10 games. Boston is playing well but the Bruins have several key injuries including Jordan Harris (ankle). Road favorite in a bounce-back spot after a tough loss to Philly.

🏀 Hornets vs Magic

🎯 HORNETS +6.5 @ -110 🎯

🟢 Sharp | NBA | 1.5u
🕐 7:00 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Sharp NBA: 26-18 (59.1%)
• NBA spreads: 88-54 (62.0%)
• Sharp Overall: 129-101 (56.1%)

💡 LaMelo Ball is questionable with a thumb contusion but has been playing through minor stuff all season. When healthy, Charlotte has one of the best net ratings over the last two weeks. Orlando is dealing with a depleted roster — Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner still working back from injuries. The line opened at +7 and moved TO Charlotte despite 73% of public tickets on Orlando. That reverse line movement screams sharp money. Getting 6.5 with LaMelo.

**3️⃣ PICK 3**

🏀 Rockets vs 76ers

🎯 76ERS +2.5 @ -110 🎯

🟢 Sharp | NBA | 1u
🕐 7:00 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Sharp NBA: 26-18 (59.1%)
• NBA spreads: 88-54 (62.0%)
• Sharp Overall: 129-101 (56.1%)

💡 Joel Embiid is PROBABLE and has played 9 of 10 games in January, averaging 26.7 points. The big news: Houston's Fred VanVleet is OUT FOR THE SEASON with a torn ACL. That's the Rockets' floor general, best defender, and emotional leader — gone. The Rockets are still good but losing VanVleet fundamentally changes who they are. Getting 2.5 points with a healthy Embiid against a team that just lost their most important player.

**4️⃣ PICK 4**

🏀 UNC Wilmington vs William & Mary

🎯 UNC WILMINGTON +2.5 @ -110 🎯

⚪ Vector | NCAAB | 1u
🕐 7:00 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Vector NCAAB: 52-47 (52.5%)
• NCAAB spreads: 98-87 (53.0%)
• Vector Overall: 113-103 (52.3%)

💡 Wilmington is 17-2 overall and 6-0 in CAA play riding a 5-game win streak. They've authored TWO double-digit comebacks in their last two games — this team doesn't quit. William & Mary is 12-6 but has dropped 3 straight away from home. UNCW leads the all-time series 51-31 and won the last 4 games at Kaplan Arena, including snapping W&M's 13-game home win streak last season. Model edge + sharp action aligned.

**5️⃣ PICK 5**
———————————————

🏀 Bulls vs Timberwolves

🎯 BULLS +9.5 @ -110 🎯

⚪ Vector | NBA | 0.5u
🕐 8:00 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Vector NBA: 31-28 (52.5%)
• NBA spreads: 98-87 (53.0%)
• Vector Overall: 113-103 (52.3%)

💡 Chicago is banged up with Josh Giddey (hamstring), Coby White (calf), and Zach Collins (toe) all OUT — that's concerning. BUT Minnesota just lost 3 straight road games to Utah, San Antonio, and Houston. Anthony Edwards dropped 55 points last night and could be gassed tonight. The Wolves scored 127, 126, and 110 in those losses — they're not blowing anyone out right now. Model projects a 6-point game. 9.5 is inflated. Half-unit due to Chicago's injury situation.

**6️⃣ PICK 6**

🏀 Eastern Illinois vs Southern Indiana

🎯 SOUTHERN INDIANA -2 @ -110 🎯

🟠 Contra | NCAAB | 1u
🕐 8:30 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Contra NCAAB: 8-5 (61.5%)
• NCAAB spreads: 98-87 (53.0%)
• Contra Overall: 22-16 (57.9%)

💡 85% of public bets on Eastern Illinois after their recent hot streak. But here's the thing: Southern Indiana is 8-2 at home while EIU is 0-9 on the road. ZERO road wins all season. The public is chasing recent results without looking at the full picture. Southern Indiana is simply the better team in their building. Classic fade-the-public spot in a small conference game.

**7️⃣ PICK 7**

🏒 Penguins vs Oilers

🎯 OILERS -1.5 @ +145 🎯

🟢 Sharp | NHL | 2u
🕐 9:00 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Sharp NHL: 41-32 (56.2%)
• NHL pucklines: 18-14 (56.3%)
• Sharp Overall: 129-101 (56.1%)

💡 Leon Draisaitl is OUT (family illness, 4th straight game), but Edmonton is 3-0 without him this season. McDavid elevates when carrying the load solo. The Penguins just traded Stuart Skinner and Brett Kulak TO Edmonton — now they're returning as Penguins for the first time. Emotional distraction for Pittsburgh. Sharp money hammering the puckline — only 48% of tickets but 89% of the money on Edmonton -1.5. At plus money against a struggling Pens team, this is the best value on the board.

**8️⃣ PICK 8**

🏒 Red Wings vs Wild

🎯 RED WINGS ML @ +135 🎯

🟢 Sharp | NHL | 1.5u
🕐 9:30 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Sharp NHL: 41-32 (56.2%)
• NHL moneylines: 39-33 (54.2%)
• Sharp Overall: 129-101 (56.1%)

💡 Minnesota is decimated by injuries. Joel Eriksson Ek is on IR. Jonas Brodin is OUT until after the Olympics. Matthew Boldy just hit IR. Marcus Johansson and Zach Bogosian also sidelined. That's 5 key rotation players gone. Detroit is 31-16-4 and riding a 3-game win streak after an OT thriller vs Toronto last night. Yes, it's a back-to-back for Detroit, but +135 against a MASH unit is too much value. Sharp money agrees — 23% of tickets, 45% of the money.
