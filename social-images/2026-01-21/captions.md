## THE ANALYSIS (Instagram Pinned Comment)

```
THE ANALYSIS 📊

NHL 🏒
    ⁃    Red Wings ML — Professional money backing Detroit as road dogs. Toronto decimated with injuries: Nylander OUT (groin), Tanev OUT (season-ending), Joshua OUT (lacerated kidney). Goalie Joseph Woll brutal in January with .884 SV%, got pulled vs Minnesota, allowed 6 to Vegas. Catching the Leafs at their lowest.
    ⁃    Ducks ML — Colorado DECIMATED. Gabriel Landeskog OUT (captain), Devon Toews OUT (best D-man), Mackenzie Blackwood OUT (starting goalie on IR). Avs turning to backup Wedgewood. Sharp money sees +275 value against a skeleton crew.

NCAAB 🏀
    ⁃    Texas +7.5 — Sharp money and model aligned. Longhorns upset Alabama ON THE ROAD and beat Kentucky 82-78 last season. Texas ranks #37 in adjusted offensive efficiency, shoots 34.5% from three. Kentucky struggles vs three-point heavy teams. 7.5 points is too many.
    ⁃    Pittsburgh -2 — 91% of public on Boston College after their first ACC win vs Syracuse. Classic overreaction. Sharp money on Pitt. Both teams 8-10, 1-4 in ACC. Fading the public with sharp confirmation.
    ⁃    Rhode Island +3.5 — Sharp money and model both backing URI. Richmond just got blown out 88-63 by Saint Louis. Rhode Island snapped a 6-game losing streak to Richmond last year with a 67-64 road win. 3.5 points of value.

NBA 🏀
    ⁃    Hornets +3.5 — Darius Garland OUT (toe sprain). Cleveland's best playmaker sidelined. Hornets have 4th-best net rating past two weeks. LaMelo rolling after a 110-87 demolition of Denver. Cavs got blown out 136-104 by OKC.
    ⁃    Hawks +1.5 — Sharp Action AND Big Money both lit. Memphis just played IN LONDON on Sunday vs Orlando. Cross-Atlantic jet lag is real. Ja Morant on minutes restriction after returning from injury. Situational edge + double-lit indicators.
    ⁃    Bucks +11.5 — OKC missing THREE key players: Jalen Williams (hamstring), Isaiah Hartenstein (soleus), Alex Caruso (adductor). Combined missing ~35 PPG, 15 RPG, elite defense. Big Money lit, PRO Systems triggered. Thunder have NEVER played without all three. Line should be closer to -5.

Loaded slate. Let's work.
