1️⃣ PICK 1 (CONSENSUS)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🏀 Louisville vs Duke

🎯 LOUISVILLE +8.5 @ -105 🎯

⚫ Vector + 🟣 Catalyst | NCAAB | 3u total
🕐 7:00 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Vector NCAAB: 29-21 (58.0%)
• Catalyst NCAAB: 4-3 (57.1%)
• NCAAB spreads: 77-57 (57.5%)

💡 Mikel Brown Jr. is BACK. The five-star freshman missed 6 weeks with back spasms and just dropped 20 points on 7-of-11 shooting with 6 assists in his return vs Virginia Tech on Saturday. Louisville's offense averaged 94 PPG with him vs 77 PPG without — that's a 17-point swing the market hasn't fully priced. Brown missed the first Duke matchup Jan 6th when the Blue Devils rallied from down 12 to win 84-73. Duke (18-1) is rolling — Cameron Boozer went for 32/9/4 Saturday vs Wake Forest — but this is a different Louisville team now. A+ Grade with 10.3% model edge. Pro Line projects +5.1, we're getting +8.5. #23 Louisville vs #5 Duke with a healthy roster. 8.5 points is too many.

2️⃣ PICK 2 (CONSENSUS)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🏀 Grizzlies vs Rockets

🎯 GRIZZLIES +10.5 @ -105 🎯

⚫ Vector + 🟢 Sharp | NBA | 3u total
🕐 8:00 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Vector NBA: 58-47 (55.2%)
• Sharp NBA: 28-18 (60.9%)
• NBA spreads: 113-73 (60.8%)

💡 Yes, Ja Morant is out 3+ weeks with a UCL sprain in his left elbow — he's missed 23 of 43 games this season. But here's what matters: Memphis has covered +10.5 in 6 straight games and 9 of their last 10. Houston is 5-7 ATS when favored by 10.5+ and 0-12 ATS at this number in their last 12 tries. Double-digit NBA spreads are historically tough to cover. Jaren Jackson Jr. and Desmond Bane have the firepower to keep this competitive. Houston also dealing with Steven Adams out after an ankle injury Sunday. A+ Grade with 13.1% model edge. Pro Line projects +6, we're getting +10.5. Sharp action confirmed — this line is overcorrected.

3️⃣ PICK 3 (CONSENSUS)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🏀 Trail Blazers vs Celtics

🎯 TRAIL BLAZERS +9.5 @ -110 🎯

🟢 Sharp + 🟣 Catalyst | NBA | 2u total
🕐 8:00 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Sharp NBA: 28-18 (60.9%)
• Catalyst NBA: 12-8 (60.0%)
• NBA spreads: 113-73 (60.8%)

💡 Classic fatigue spot. Boston is playing their 3rd game in 4 nights. Jaylen Brown logged 46 minutes in a double-OT win over Brooklyn on Friday (triple-double: 27/12/10), then 37 minutes Saturday in a loss to Chicago where he scored 33 despite hamstring tightness that landed him on the injury report. He's off the report tonight but those minutes don't disappear. The Celtics are 28-17 — not the juggernaut people think. We got +9.5 when consensus is +7.5 — that's 2 points of line value. Sharp action confirmed on Portland. Nearly double digits against a tired Boston squad is too many points.

4️⃣ PICK 4
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🏒 Utah vs Lightning

🎯 UTAH ML @ +138 🎯

🟢 Sharp | NHL | 1u
🕐 7:00 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Sharp NHL: 45-43 (51.2%)
• NHL moneylines: 32-33 (49.2%)
• Sharp Overall: 142-111 (56.1%)

💡 Tampa Bay's defensive corps is in crisis mode. Victor Hedman (elbow) is on LTIR after surgery. Erik Cernak went into the boards Saturday in Columbus and is a game-time decision at best after leaving the 8-5 loss early. The Lightning were down to 15 skaters by the end of that blowout with multiple players dealing with illness. Utah (27-20-4) is riding a 5-game winning streak after beating Nashville 5-2. Karel Vejmelka has been outstanding in net. The sharp money tells the story: only 14% of tickets on Utah but 33% of the money — a 19% divergence at plus money. When professionals take the underdog at +138, we follow.

5️⃣ PICK 5
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🏀 Arizona vs BYU

🎯 ARIZONA +1 @ -110 🎯

⚫ Vector | NCAAB | 2u
🕐 9:00 PM ET

📊 Track Record:
• Vector NCAAB: 29-21 (58.0%)
• NCAAB spreads: 77-57 (57.5%)
• Vector Overall: 117-105 (52.7%)

💡 The #1 team in the country getting points. Arizona (20-0) travels to BYU (17-2) and our model projects the Wildcats as 4.3-point favorites — we're getting +1. That's a 5+ point swing of value. BYU has been excellent, led by potential #1 pick AJ Dybantsa who just dropped 43 points Saturday vs Utah. But the Cougars are missing key depth — Dawson Baker (ACL) and Nate Pickens are both out for the season. The "Big 3" of Dybantsa, Richie Saunders, and Rob Wright have been carrying the load, but that's a lot of weight against an undefeated Arizona squad. A Grade with 9.8% model edge. The market is overweighting BYU's home court.
