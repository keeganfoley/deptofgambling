# THESIS LANGUAGE GUIDE

> **This document defines how to write thesis/analysis text for bets.**
> **KEY RULE: Never mention specific data source names on the frontend.**

---

## THE GOLDEN RULE

**Backend:** Store all raw data (Sharp Action lit, Big Money lit, AN edge, etc.)
**Frontend:** Only show professionally written analysis without source names

---

## FORBIDDEN TERMS (Never Use in Thesis)

These terms are **internal/backend only** and must NEVER appear in thesis text:

| FORBIDDEN | WHY |
|-----------|-----|
| "Action Network" | Specific source name |
| "Action Network PRO" | Specific source name |
| "AN edge" | Source abbreviation |
| "Sharp Action lit" | Internal indicator name |
| "Big Money lit" | Internal indicator name |
| "PRO Systems triggered" | Internal indicator name |
| "PRO projections" | Internal indicator name |
| "DIFF calculation" | Internal metric name |
| "Sharp Score" | Internal metric name |
| "Conviction Score" | Internal metric name |

---

## TRANSLATION TABLE

Use this table to convert internal language to professional thesis language:

| Internal Term | Professional Alternative |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| Sharp Action lit | "Professional money is backing..." / "Smart money indicators favor..." |
| Big Money lit | "Significant money moving to..." / "Large wagers concentrated on..." |
| Both Sharp + Big Money | "Multiple sharp indicators aligned on..." |
| PRO projections | "Our model projects..." / "Model analysis shows..." |
| AN edge 8.5% | "8.5% edge based on our projections" |
| DIFF -15% | "Money diverging from public tickets by 15%..." |
| Positive DIFF | "Professional money backing this side despite public sentiment" |
| PRO Systems triggered | "Historical patterns favor..." / "Situational factors align..." |
| Sharp Score 8+ | "Strong smart money indicators present" |
| RLM detected | "Line has moved opposite to public betting, suggesting sharp interest" |
| Grade A- | "Strong model grade supporting this play" |
| Conviction 75 | (Don't mention - it's internal) |

## THESIS STRUCTURE

Every thesis should:

1. **Open with the WHY** - Why does this edge exist?
2. **Support with DATA** - Use numbers, but translate the source
3. **Explain the LOGIC** - Why would we win?
4. **Acknowledge RISK** - What could go wrong?

### Example - BAD Thesis (Internal Language)

> "Action Network PRO shows A- grade with 8.5% edge. Sharp Action lit and Big Money lit. DIFF is +12%. PRO Systems triggered. Conviction Score 78."

### Example - GOOD Thesis (Professional Language)

> "Our model projects an 8.5% edge on this spread. Professional money is backing this side despite 65% of public tickets going the other way - that 12% divergence between money and bets suggests sharps see value here. The line has moved from -3 to -4.5 against public sentiment, classic reverse line movement. Historical situational patterns also favor this spot. Key risk: if the starter is ruled out, re-evaluate."

---

## BY FUND TYPE

### VectorFund (Model Edge)

**Focus on:** Projection vs market, efficiency ratings, matchup advantages

```
GOOD: "Model projects this as a 6-point game, but we're getting 9.5 points.
       The efficiency differential and pace mismatch support the model's read."

BAD:  "AN shows A- grade and 8.5% edge. PRO LINE says +6."
```

### SharpFund (Sharp Money)

**Focus on:** Money movement, professional interest, line movement

```
GOOD: "Professional money has moved this line from -3 to -5 despite 70% of
       public tickets on the other side. That divergence signals sharp interest."

BAD:  "Sharp Action lit and Big Money lit. DIFF +15%. RLM confirmed."
```

### ContraFund (Fade Public)

**Focus on:** Public bias, market inefficiency, popular team tax

```
GOOD: "72% of bets on the favorite but money is split 50/50. When the public
       pounds a popular team but sharps don't follow, we fade."

BAD:  "Public 72%, Money 50%, DIFF -22%. Contrarian Score 45."
```

### CatalystFund (Situational)

**Focus on:** Rest, travel, schedule, revenge, motivation

```
GOOD: "Third road game in four nights for the favorite, while the dog is
       rested with two days off. Historical data shows this rest advantage
       is worth 1.5-2 points."

BAD:  "PRO Systems triggered: Road Dog Rest Advantage. Situational Score 6.5."
```

---

## NUMBERS ARE FINE

You CAN use:
- Edge percentages: "8.5% edge"
- Win rates: "This spot is 65% ATS historically"
- Line movement: "Line moved from -3 to -5"
- Public percentages: "72% of bets on the other side"
- Point values: "Getting 2.5 extra points vs opening"

You CANNOT reference:
- Where the numbers came from specifically
- Internal indicator names
- Scoring systems (Sharp Score, Conviction Score)

---

## QUICK CHECKLIST

Before saving any thesis, verify:

- [ ] No mention of "Action Network" or "AN"
- [ ] No mention of "Sharp Action lit" or "Big Money lit"
- [ ] No mention of "PRO" anything (projections, systems, etc.)
- [ ] No mention of "DIFF" or "Sharp Score" or "Conviction Score"
- [ ] Explains WHY we're betting this (not just WHAT the signals say)
- [ ] Uses professional, fund-manager language
- [ ] Includes relevant numbers without source attribution

---

## THE TEST

Read the thesis out loud. Ask:

> "Would this sound professional if I posted it publicly?"
> "Does it explain the reasoning, not just list indicators?"
> "Could a reader understand WHY we like this bet?"

If yes to all three, it's good.
