```
[DATE IN ALL CAPS] | [W]-[L], [dynamic content]. #sportsbetting #deptofgambling #freepicks
```

### Dynamic Content Logic:
- **Winning day (profit > 0):** "another profitable day"
- **Losing day (profit < 0):** "tough beat(s)"
- **Break even / close:** "tight slate"
- **Big win (profit > $500):** "big day for the Department"
- **Sweep (0 losses):** "perfect day"

### Examples:
```
DECEMBER 16 | 4-2, another profitable day. #sportsbetting #deptofgambling #freepicks
```
```
DECEMBER 15 | 2-4, tough beats. #sportsbetting #deptofgambling #freepicks
```
```
DECEMBER 14 | 8-2, big day for the Department. #sportsbetting #deptofgambling #freepicks
```
```
DECEMBER 13 | 5-0, perfect day. #sportsbetting #deptofgambling #freepicks
