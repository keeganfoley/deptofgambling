## Thesis Writing Rules (LOCKED)

### 1. Complete Sentences Only
- ❌ "With 4 Cleveland players OUT."
- ✅ "Cleveland is missing 4 key players."
- Every thesis must start with a proper complete sentence

### 2. No Betting Jargon - Plain English Only
| Jargon | Plain English |
|--------|---------------|
| RLM | "The line moved against the public" |
| Sharp Action lit | "Sharp money is on..." |
| DIFF | Remove or explain: "big gap between tickets and money" |
| Steam | "Heavy betting" or "The line got hammered" |
| H2H | "head-to-head" or "last X meetings" |
| Edge | "value" or "advantage" |
| PRO Model | "Our model" |

### 3. Clear H2H Records
- ❌ "Jets dominate H2H (15-20 historically)" - confusing
- ✅ "Jets have won 15 of the last 35 meetings"
- Always make it clear which team the record favors

### 4. No Internal Scoring References
- ❌ "Sharp Score of 5"
- ✅ "Multiple sharp indicators aligned"
- ❌ "Situational score of 5.0 supports dual-fund play"
- ✅ "The situation favors this play"
- ❌ "(B+ grade, 7% edge)"
- ✅ "solid value"

### 5. Only Include Stats That SUPPORT the Pick
- Every fact in the thesis should support why we're betting it
- Never include a stat that argues against the pick
- ❌ "Jets have won 15 of the last 35 meetings" (losing record - remove it)
- ✅ "Jets have won 20 of the last 30 meetings" (winning record - keep it)
- If a stat doesn't help the case, leave it out entirely

## ⚠️ MANDATORY WEB SEARCH FOR THESIS CONTENT (LOCKED)

**Before generating any Discord #all-picks messages, you MUST do a web search for EACH game to gather real, factual information.**

**For each pick, search:** `"[Team A] vs [Team B] [Date] preview injuries"`

**Gather and include in the 💡 thesis:**
1. **INJURIES** - Who's OUT, questionable, day-to-day (with specific injury type)
2. **RECENT RESULTS** - H2H record, win/loss streaks, home/away records
3. **LINE MOVEMENT** - Where the line opened vs where it is now
4. **RELEVANT STATS** - Defensive rankings, scoring averages, ATS records
5. **CONTEXT** - Weather (for outdoor games), motivation factors, playoff implications

**THESIS RULES:**
- Every fact must be from web search, not made up
- Include specific names, numbers, and stats
- Explain WHY the signals matter in plain English
- Make it sound like explaining to a friend, not a robot

**CRITICAL: ONLY INCLUDE INFO THAT SUPPORTS THE PICK**
- Every piece of information in the thesis MUST support WHY we're betting this pick
- Do NOT include random facts that don't connect to the thesis
- Do NOT include stats that argue AGAINST the pick
- If an injury hurts our pick (not helps it), don't mention it
- Every sentence should answer: "Why should I bet this?"
- Tie everything back to the core reason we're on this side

**Example of what NOT to do:**
❌ "The Lakers are 5-3 in their last 8 games. LeBron had 30 points last game. The Jazz are from Utah."
(Random facts, not tied to thesis)

**Example of what TO do:**
✅ "The Lakers have already beaten Utah twice this season. The Jazz are missing Walker Kessler for the season after shoulder surgery. This line opened at -6.5 and has moved to -9.5 - that's 3 points of sharp money pushing the number. The sharps see a blowout."
(Every fact supports WHY we're betting Lakers -9.5)

**NEVER generate Discord pick messages without doing web searches first. This is non-negotiable.**

---

## PICKS RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)

Before generating ANY pick for Discord, Claude MUST web search and verify:

### WHAT TO INCLUDE (Relevant):
- Line movement in the last 24-48 hours and WHY
- Injuries announced TODAY or YESTERDAY that aren't priced in yet
- Back-to-back situations, travel (arrived at 3am, etc.)
- Recent head-to-head results (last 2-3 meetings)
- Hot/cold streaks in last 5-10 games
- Specific matchup advantages (pace, defense vs position, etc.)
- Weather for outdoor games (if significant)

### WHAT TO EXCLUDE (Irrelevant - DO NOT MENTION):
- Injuries from weeks/months ago (already priced in)
- Trades from more than 2 weeks ago (already priced in)
- "Star player out for season" if they've been out for weeks
- Generic team descriptions ("they're a good defensive team")
- Anything that doesn't DIRECTLY support THIS specific pick
- Old news dressed up as current ("Luka has been dealing with..." if it's been ongoing)

### RELEVANCE TEST:
Before including ANY fact, ask: "Would a sharp bettor already know this and would it already be reflected in the line?" If YES → don't include it.

Only include information that:
1. Is from the last 48 hours OR
2. Is a specific matchup stat that supports the thesis OR
3. Is situational (rest, travel, revenge) that's verifiable
