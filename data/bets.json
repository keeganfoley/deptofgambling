Philadelphia's catastrophic 15-point fourth quarter exposed one-man team limitations. Pistons' 9-game win streak reflected organizational depth and Coach Bickerstaff's defensive system, not luck. Jenkins' 52-foot buzzer-beater (cut 5-pt lead to 2) shifted momentum into 4th. Detroit had beaten PHI 111-108 five days earlier - betting them to cover +2 in Detroit after losing by 3 in Philly ignored critical recent H2H data.

Georgia controlled possession 35:09 to 24:51, total yards 357-274. Georgia outscored Texas 21-0 in 4th quarter alone, turning competitive game into rout. Texas managed only 274 total yards against UGA's suffocating defense. Fundamental error: underestimated Stockton's breakout performance and Georgia's home-field dominance at Sanford Stadium (8-1 ATS at home this season). Texas's offense completely overwhelmed, couldn't establish run (89 rush yards) or pass (185 pass yards). Wrong side entirely - should have faded Texas on road against elite SEC defense.",

Eli Bowen's 87-yard pick-six gave OU early 10-0 lead and momentum. Defense dominated throughout: held Alabama to 21 points, forced critical mistakes in red zone. Tate Sandell's 52-yard FG extended lead, then game-sealing 24-yard FG provided insurance. John Mateer's 20-yard rushing TD and Daniel Hill's 1-yard TD run for Alabama rounded out scoring.

This double-dip strategy paid off huge - collected on both positions with dominant 17-point victory. Getting +124 (implied 44.6% probability) on team with 55-60% true win probability created +10-15% edge. Combined with spread bet, Suns bets generated +$252.48 profit total ($190.48 spread + $62 ML).

    "analysis": "The market overcorrected. Patrick Mahomes tore two knee ligaments two weeks ago. Gardner Minshew tore his knee last week. The line swung 18 points from Chiefs -4.5 to +13.5. Chris Oladokun makes his first career start, but he went 11-of-16 for 111 yards with no turnovers in relief last week. Andy Reid said the playbook will be simplified but they can still do enough. Reid at home on Christmas as a 13.5-point dog? The smart money says that's too many points."
