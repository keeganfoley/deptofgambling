## 🧮 HONEST WIN PROBABILITY PER BET

Let me calculate TRUE expected win rates based on what we KNOW:

### 1. Saquon Barkley O70.5 @ -110
**Win Probability: 58-60%** (not 68%)
- Eagles favored = run-heavy ✅
- Lions backup DBs = can't stack box ✅
- BUT: If Eagles up huge early, might rest him
- TRUE EDGE: ~5-7% (small but real)

### 2. St. Brown O7.5 Receptions @ +117
**Win Probability: 56-58%** (not 60%)
- LaPorta out = more targets ✅
- Lions trailing = pass volume ✅
- **PLUS ODDS = mathematical edge even at 56%** ✅
- TRUE EDGE: ~8-10% (best play due to odds)

### 3. Hurts O30.5 Rush Yards @ -105
**Win Probability: 52-54%** (basically coin flip)
- RPO game likely ✅
- Clock control ✅
- BUT: Eagles might go ultra-conservative if up big
- TRUE EDGE: ~2-4% (marginal)

### 4. AJ Brown O59.5 Rec Yards @ -115
**Win Probability: 54-57%**
- Backup DBs defending him ✅
- BUT: Report says sharp money on UNDER 46.5 = low scoring game
- If Eagles only score 24 via run game, Brown might get 3-4 catches for 45 yards
- TRUE EDGE: ~3-6% (small)

## 📊 MATHEMATICAL EXPECTED VALUE

### Portfolio A: 6 Units (All 4 Bets)
**Assuming 56% average win rate per bet:**

| Outcome | Probability | Profit/Loss | Expected Value |
|---------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| 4-0 | 9.8% | +6.5U | +0.64U |
| 3-1 | 31.2% | +2.3U | +0.72U |
| 2-2 | 37.4% | -0.4U | -0.15U |
| 1-3 | 18.7% | -3.4U | -0.64U |
| 0-4 | 2.9% | -6.6U | -0.19U |

**TOTAL EXPECTED VALUE: +0.38U on 6U risked = 6.3% ROI**

**Translation:** Over 100 similar bets, we'd expect to profit 6%. But with only 4 bets tonight, **variance is HUGE**.

**Probability of LOSING money: 58.9%** (2-2, 1-3, or 0-4)
**Probability of PROFITING: 41.1%** (3-1 or 4-0)

**This is NOT a hedgefund approach.** Way too much variance.

## 🏦 TRUE HEDGEFUND APPROACH: Risk-Adjusted Portfolio

### Portfolio B: 4 Units (Top 2 Plays Only)
**Focus on HIGHEST EDGE plays:**

1. **2U** St. Brown O7.5 @ +117 (best edge due to plus odds)
2. **2U** Saquon O70.5 @ -110 (safest game script logic)

**Why only these two:**
- St. Brown: 56% win prob at +117 odds = **+12% EV**
- Saquon: 58% win prob at -110 odds = **+7% EV**
- Hurts: 53% win prob at -105 odds = **+1% EV** (skip it)
- AJ Brown: 55% win prob at -115 odds = **+4% EV** (skip it)

**Expected outcomes at 57% win rate:**

| Outcome | Probability | Profit/Loss | Expected Value |
|---------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| 2-0 | 32.5% | +3.8U | +1.23U |
| 1-1 | 49.0% | -0.2U | -0.10U |
| 0-2 | 18.5% | -4.0U | -0.74U |

**TOTAL EXPECTED VALUE: +0.39U on 4U risked = 9.8% ROI**

**Probability of LOSING money: 18.5%** (only if both miss)
**Probability of BREAKING EVEN: 49.0%** (1-1 split)
**Probability of PROFITING: 32.5%** (both hit)

**Much better risk profile.** We can afford to lose 4U. We can't afford to lose 6U.

## 💡 EVEN MORE CONSERVATIVE: Portfolio C (3U)

**If you want to "barely lose anything if we lose":**

1. **2U** St. Brown O7.5 @ +117 (highest edge, plus odds)
2. **1U** Saquon O70.5 @ -110 (safest logic)

**Expected outcomes:**

| Outcome | Probability | Profit/Loss |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| 2-0 | 32.5% | +3.0U |
| 1-1 | 49.0% | +0.9U |
| 0-2 | 18.5% | -3.0U |

**Even 0-2 only loses 3U.** Much safer.

## 🎲 WHICH PORTFOLIO IS RIGHT?

### **If this is ONE NIGHT of betting:**
→ **Portfolio C (3U)** - Conservative, low risk
- Max loss: 3U
- Expected profit: +0.25U
- Low variance

### **If this is part of LONG-TERM strategy:**
→ **Portfolio B (4U)** - Balanced
- Max loss: 4U
- Expected profit: +0.39U
- Better ROI, manageable variance

### **If you want maximum exposure:**
→ **Portfolio A (6U)** - Aggressive
- Max loss: 6.6U
- Expected profit: +0.38U
- High variance, not worth the risk

## ⚠️ CRITICAL INSIGHT FROM THE REPORT

**Sharp money is on UNDER 46.5.**

This means sharps expect: 24-20, 27-20, 23-17 type scores.

**If Eagles win 24-20:**
- Saquon gets 18-20 carries, 85-95 yards → **HITS** ✅
- Hurts rushes 5-6 times, 25-35 yards → **CLOSE** (variance)
- AJ Brown: 4 catches, 52 yards → **MISSES** ❌
- St. Brown: Lions score 20 in catch-up mode, needs 8-10 targets, gets 8-9 catches → **HITS** ✅

**If Eagles win 27-17:**
- Saquon: **HITS** ✅
- Hurts: **CLOSE** (50/50)
- AJ Brown: **CLOSE** (50/50)
- St. Brown: **HITS** ✅

**Pattern: Saquon and St. Brown have highest hit probability.**

## 🏆 FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**Portfolio B: 4 Units Total**
- **2U** Amon-Ra St. Brown O7.5 Receptions @ +117 (DraftKings)
- **2U** Saquon Barkley O70.5 Rush Yards @ -110 (Fanatics)

**Why this is the hedgefund approach:**
1. **Focus on highest-edge plays only** (skip marginal Hurts/Brown)
2. **Risk management:** Max loss is 4U, we can absorb that
3. **Diversification:** Different teams, different prop types
4. **Expected ROI: ~10%** over many similar bets
5. **Aligns with sharp money:** Run-heavy Eagles, pass-heavy Lions

**Expected outcome tonight:**
- 40% chance we profit 3.8U (both hit)
- 42% chance we break even or lose 0.2U (split)
- 18% chance we lose 4U (both miss)

**Over 100 similar nights, we profit ~10%.**

## 🚨 DO NOT BET 6U

The Hurts and AJ Brown plays add variance without adding enough edge. They're **+EV but barely**, and the extra risk isn't worth it.

**Stick to the two plays with clearest edges: St. Brown and Saquon.**

**Are you comfortable with this approach?**
