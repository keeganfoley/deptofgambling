  "verdict": "Sound process producing expected results with dominant execution. Suns won outright 127-110, covering +2.5 spread by 19.5 points. Blazers' injury crisis (Lillard, Holiday out) proved insurmountable as modeled. Suns' balanced attack (Durant 24, Beal 22, Booker 19) overwhelmed Portland's depleted roster. Getting +2.5 on road favorite created massive value - market inefficiency exploited perfectly. This represents proper handicapping: identified clear talent gap via star injuries, bet superior team, watched blowout domination. Would make this bet 100 times out of 100 under identical circumstances. Textbook execution of injury-based edge."
