  "verdict": "Perfect execution of double-dip strategy producing maximum value. Suns ML +124 cashed with 17-point outright win (127-110). Getting +124 (implied 44.6% probability) on team with 55-60% true win probability created +10-15% edge. Paired with Suns +2.5 spread (2u), this ML bet (0.5u) maximized profit potential via correlated positions. Combined profit: $252.48 ($190.48 spread + $62 ML). This validates portfolio theory: when strong conviction on outright win, adding small ML position on plus odds extracts maximum value. Both bets cashed perfectly with Suns' dominant performance.
