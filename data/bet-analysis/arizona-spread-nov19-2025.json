    "Love's go-ahead three (5:17 left) and Dell'Orso's 9 final-5-min points epitomize clutch veteran performances",
    "Neutral site negated UConn home advantage - experienced teams thrive without crowd factors",
    "Early season championship teams still finding identity - capitalize on adjustment periods",
    "1u stake appropriate for NCAAB given variance but sharp line movement demanded action",
    "For quantitative operations: trust sharp money line movements of 1.5+ points, hit rate exceeds 60%"

  "wouldBetAgain": true,
  "verdict": "Perfect execution following sharp money and veteran edge thesis. Every pre-game indicator materialized: line moved from +5 to +6.5 on sharp Arizona money (validated by outright win), veteran guards Dell'Orso and Love combined for 38 points with 20 of final 26 (clutch closing), Arizona's defense held UConn to 2-11 FG in final 8 minutes (suffocating pressure), rebounding dominance (+7) controlled game. Won outright by 4 as +6.5 underdog - covered by 10.5 points. This represents textbook sharp money follow with veteran advantage on neutral court. Would make this bet 100 times - sharp bettors moved line for reason. Trust the market signals."
