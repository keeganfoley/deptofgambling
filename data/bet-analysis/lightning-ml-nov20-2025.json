  "wouldBetAgain": true,
  "verdict": "Perfect execution of situational NHL handicapping. Back-to-back road team with worst goalie situation in NHL vs rested home team with elite Vasilevskiy. Every thesis materialized: fatigue showed in 2nd period (2-0 Lightning), goaltending edge decisive (Vasy .923 vs Pickard .871), depth overwhelmed top-heavy Oilers. McDavid limited to single goal despite 8 SOG. This is exploitable edge - would bet this spot repeatedly."
