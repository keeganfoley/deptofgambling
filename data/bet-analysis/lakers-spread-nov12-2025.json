    "Large spreads aren't safe when elite teams click: 8.5 points felt like cushion, but Thunder's 29-point blowout showed elite teams can destroy",
    "Blowouts kill spread bets quickly: 70-38 halftime meant game was over by intermission. No chance for garbage-time cover",
    "Thunder's defense elite even without Dort: Assumed missing Lu Dort would weaken defense. Wrong. They have multiple elite defenders (SGA, others)",

Underestimated Thunder's defensive dominance and Lakers' dependence on LeBron. 1.5U stake was manageable but still painful. Grade: F"
