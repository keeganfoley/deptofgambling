    "Home dome advantage is real - crowd noise disrupts communication",
    "Line shopping paid off massively - +100 vs -110 was 2.4% free edge",
    "Trust the process - public faded 'backup QB' narrative while sharps hammered Texans",
    "Texans defense now holds opponents to 17.8 PPG - sustainable elite performance",
    "Allen can be contained by top defenses - he's human"

  "wouldBetAgain": true,
  "verdict": "Best bet of the night. Plus money on spread with #1 defense was textbook value. Every thesis materialized: Texans defense dominated Allen (79.2 rating), Mills managed game perfectly (108.3 rating, 0 turnovers), home field advantage evident. Won OUTRIGHT - didn't even need the 5.5 points. Getting +100 odds when it should be -110 is free money, and we maximized it with 2-unit bet. This is what edge-based betting looks like. Would make this bet 100 times out of 100 under identical circumstances."
