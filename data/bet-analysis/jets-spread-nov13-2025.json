The thesis was 100% correct: Jets' defense kept game close (20-14 through 3 quarters), home underdog trend showed up (covering for 95% of game), and sharp money was right (should've covered). But two critical moments killed it: (1) Jets failing 4th-and-3 at NE 32 when trailing by 6, and (2) Patriots scoring late TD to push margin to 13. If Jets convert that 4th down and score TD, they likely win outright or cover easily. Missing by 0.5 points is the definition of bad variance - right side, wrong result."

  "verdict": "Heartbreaking loss with strong process. Jets covered +12.5 for 95% of the game, trailing just 20-14 entering Q4. Critical 4th-down failure (4th-and-3 at NE 32) killed their comeback, and Patriots scored late TD to push margin to 13 (missing cover by 0.5 points). Thesis was sound: elite Jets defense delivered (held Patriots to 27), Thursday night home underdog trend showed up (competitive all game), and sharp money was correct (reverse line movement validated). This is a bad beat, not a bad bet. If Jets convert 4th down and score TD, they likely win outright. Right side, brutal variance. Grade: B+ (excellent process, unlucky outcome)",
