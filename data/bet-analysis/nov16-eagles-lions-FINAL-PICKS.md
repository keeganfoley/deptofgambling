---

## 🎯 FINAL PICKS - 5 UNITS TOTAL

### 1️⃣ **TOP PLAY - 2 UNITS**
**Saquon Barkley OVER 78.5 Rush Yards @ -110** (Fanatics)
- **Edge: 15.6% | EV: +29.8%**
- **Confidence: SUPER HIGH** (but not "100%" - Lions are 8-1 for a reason)
- Lions rank **25th in rush defense** (4.7 YPC allowed)
- Saquon averaging 5.8 YPC, 109.9 YPG - hit OVER in 8/10 games
- Eagles favored at home = positive game script = **18-22 carries minimum**
- Lions allow 135+ rush YPG - this is the best matchup
- **Risk:** Eagles up huge, rest him 4th quarter (but he'll have 70+ by then)

### 2️⃣ **VALUE PLAY - 2 UNITS**
**Amon-Ra St. Brown OVER 7.5 Receptions @ -120** (DraftKings)
- **Edge: 11.9% | EV: +25.9%**
- **Confidence: SUPER CONFIDENT** - volume-based play
- St. Brown averaging **8.4 receptions/game** (literally his average is above the line)
- Lions playing from behind = Goff's #1 target gets **VOLUME**
- Eagles slot coverage is vulnerable
- **Line moved from +117 to -120 on sharp action**
- **Risk:** Lions somehow dominate run game (very unlikely as road dogs)

### 3️⃣ **SOLID PLAY - 1 UNIT**
**Jalen Hurts OVER 30.5 Rush Yards @ -105** (Fanatics)
- **Edge: 10.8% | EV: +21.0%**
- **Confidence: CONFIDENT** - good edge, proven trend
- Hit OVER in **7 of last 9 games**
- Lions rank 25th vs run, RPO game will exploit their aggressiveness
- Designed runs + scrambles = path to 35+ yards
- **Risk:** Eagles go ultra-conservative if up big (but RPOs still happen)

## 📊 UNIT SCALE APPLIED

- **1.0 U** = Confident (10%+ edge, solid reasoning)
- **2.0 U** = Super Confident (12%+ edge, clear value, plus matchup data)
- **2.5 U** = Extremely Confident (15%+ edge, dominant matchup, market mispricing)
- **3.0 U** = "THIS IS A JOKE 100% HIT" = RESERVED (would need 20%+ edge + perfect storm)

**None of these are 3U because Lions are 8-1 and this is the NFL** - anything can happen. But all 3 have **elite quantitative edges**.

---

## 🎲 ACTUAL BETS PLACED: 5 UNITS TOTAL

**Final Card:**
- 2U Saquon O78.5 @ -110
- 2U St. Brown O7.5 @ -120
- 1U Hurts O30.5 @ -105

All three plays have **10%+ mathematical edge**. The unit sizing properly reflects:
1. **Saquon** = Best matchup, highest edge, most volume certainty
2. **St. Brown** = Volume-based play + proven target share + game script
3. **Hurts** = Solid trend + exploitable matchup + lower variance

**Expected Return:**
- Conservative (2-1): +0.9 units
- Base Case (3-0): +4.5 units

## ⚠️ WHAT COULD GO WRONG

1. **Saquon:** Eagles up 35-10, bench him at halftime (he'd need 78.5 in 2 quarters - possible but tight)
2. **St. Brown:** Jameson Williams goes nuclear, steals targets (unlikely - St. Brown is Goff's binky)
3. **Hurts:** Eagles decide to be pocket passers all game (hasn't happened all year)

**None of these are 100% locks** - this is the NFL. But mathematically, these are **mispriced by the market**.

---

## 🧮 WHY THE MARKET IS WRONG

Public sees: Lions 8-1, Eagles 7-2 = close game
**Sharp sees:** Lions 25th rush defense, Eagles run-first offense with Saquon = **MISMATCH**

Public sees: St. Brown line at 7.5
**Sharp sees:** 8.4 average receptions + negative game script + volume certainty = **VALUE**

Public sees: Hurts rush line at 30.5
**Sharp sees:** 7/9 overs, RPO-heavy offense vs 25th rush defense = **VALUE**

We're betting **matchups and tendencies**, not **records**.
