But we failed to account for Patriots' ultra-conservative philosophy in blowouts. When Patriots went up 17-7, they completely abandoned passing in red zone. Henderson got 3 goal-line rushing TDs that easily could've been Maye passing TDs in a competitive game. This is a lesson in betting props for teams that play conservative when leading. Maye was great, but game script killed passing TD upside."

    "Maye played great (281 yards) but volume wasn't there: Only 3 red zone pass attempts after Q1",
    "Henderson's 3 rushing TDs vultured all passing TD opportunities from 1-2 yard line"

  "verdict": "Frustrating loss with correct process. Excellent CLV (+10 cents), Maye played phenomenally (281 yards, 0 INT, 102.4 rating), and Jets' pass defense was indeed vulnerable. But Patriots' ultra-conservative game script after building lead killed red zone passing volume. Henderson got 3 goal-line rushing TDs that easily could've been Maye passing TDs in competitive game. This is a sharp lesson: avoid passing TD overs for teams with conservative coaching philosophies (Belichick-style) when they're heavy favorites. Right player, right matchup, wrong situational awareness. Grade: B- (strong thesis, failed to account for game script risk)",
