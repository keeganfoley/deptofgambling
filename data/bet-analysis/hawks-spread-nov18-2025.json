    "Hawks 5-game home win streak ended - all streaks break eventually",
    "Momentum factor in 10+ game winning streaks should be weighted higher than rest advantage",
    "Fundamental misread: underestimated Pistons' excellence, overestimated situational factors",
    "Hawks defensive lapses (allowing 120 points at home) were critical - can't win covering spread allowing that",
    "Pistons' 48.9% FG on road back-to-back shows championship-level execution",
    "For quantitative operations: historic win streaks > rest advantage in NBA handicapping",
    "Wrong side - Pistons proved depth and coaching overcome fatigue when momentum this strong"

  "wouldBetAgain": false,
  "verdict": "Flawed analysis producing deserved loss. Underestimated Pistons' 10-game winning streak momentum being bigger than back-to-back fatigue factor. Should have recognized that historic winning streaks often transcend situational handicaps. Cunningham (24-8-5) and Harris (18-7) both played through questionable status and dominated. Hawks couldn't slow Pistons' momentum despite home court advantage. Detroit's organizational excellence (depth, coaching, culture) proved superior to Hawks' situational edge (rested legs, home crowd). This was fundamental misread, not variance. Pistons won 120-112, missing Hawks +1.5 spread by 6.5 points. Would NOT make this bet again under identical circumstances. When team has 10+ game win streak and shows championship culture, situational factors (rest, travel) matter less than assumed. Expensive lesson in proper momentum evaluation."
