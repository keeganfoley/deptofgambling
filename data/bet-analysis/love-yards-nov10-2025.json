While Love's season average (267.3 YPG) supported the over, the MNF defensive environment (Eagles' elite pass rush + frigid Lambeau weather) created perfect storm for under. Phillips' debut dominance (7 pressures) and 0-0 halftime score showed game script disaster from opening kickoff. Should have respected potential for defensive slugfest more heavily."
