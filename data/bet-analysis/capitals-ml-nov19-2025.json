  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Capitals' home dominance (now 7-1) continues to be exploitable edge - home ice worth 0.3-0.5 goals in NHL",

    "Ovechkin's 2G/1A shows veteran stars deliver in home games with favorable matchups",
    "Defensive structure (16 blocked shots, physical play) limited Oilers' high-danger chances to 10",
    "First period leads against tired teams create insurmountable advantage - opponent forced to chase on heavy legs",
    "McDavid/Draisaitl still dangerous (combined 2G/2A) but team effort beats individual stars when fatigued",
    "Small stake (0.5u) appropriate for NHL given variance, but clear edges should still be exploited",
    "Capitals' special teams (1/3 PP, 75% PK) contributed to victory without being dominant - team win"
  ],
  "wouldBetAgain": true,
  "verdict": "Textbook exploitation of home ice advantage vs road-fatigued opponent. Every thesis materialized: Capitals' first period jump (2-1) forced tired Oilers to chase, defense limited dangerous McDavid/Draisaitl duo to just 4 combined points, Ovechkin delivered vintage performance (2G/1A), physical play wore down fatigued Edmonton. Oilers' back-to-back showed in third period lack of pushback until too late. Small stake (0.5u) reflected NHL variance but edge was clear. Captured positive CLV (-115 vs closing -120). Process-driven win - would make this bet repeatedly under identical circumstances. Home teams vs road back-to-backs hit at 57%+ historically."
