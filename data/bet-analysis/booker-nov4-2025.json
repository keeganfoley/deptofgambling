    "High game totals (236.5) create scoring environment - more possessions = more points",
    "Revenge narratives provide subtle psychological edge (not primary factor but additive)",
    "Usage rate changes without star teammates are HIGHLY predictive (+6.3 PPG without KD historically)",
    "Hit OVER by 9.5 points - not just a win, but a dominant cover showing true edge size",
    "This is what 'smash spot' means - multiple edge layers stacking (defense, usage, pace, venue, motivation)"

  "wouldBetAgain": true,
  "verdict": "Elite process with dominant result. Every edge layer materialized. This is the platonic ideal of a +EV props bet."
