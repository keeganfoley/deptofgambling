    "Six Wolves in double figures showcased depth advantage - Anthony Edwards (13), Randle (18), Gobert (15), McDaniels (15), Reid (22)",
    "Mavericks' six-player injury crisis proved fatal - missing Irving, Davis, Gafford, Lively, Exum, Nembhard created G-League roster",
    "Schedule spot disaster for Dallas - back-to-back after double-OT, five-games-in-seven-days, travel fatigue overwhelming",
    "Defensive suffocation in Q3 (11 points allowed) epitomized elite Wolves defense - Gobert's rim protection destroyed Dallas",
    "Rebounding dominance (51-38) and paint advantage (58-44) controlled game - physicality overwhelming tired Mavs",
    "Covered -14.5 by 9.5 despite Q4 garbage time - Mavericks outscored Wolves 41-29 in Q4 but never threatened spread",
    "For quantitative operations: bet healthy home teams vs injury-depleted road teams on back-to-backs, spreads hit 75%+ in this spot",
    "Double-digit spreads always risky but justified here - Mavericks' injuries + schedule = non-competitive game, final margin 24"
  ],
  "wouldBetAgain": true,
  "verdict": "Elite handicapping of injury and schedule spot producing expected results. Every pre-game thesis materialized: Mavericks' six-player injury crisis created non-competitive game, schedule spot (back-to-back) amplified fatigue, Wolves' elite defense (11 Q3 points allowed) suffocated Dallas, depth advantage (Reid's historic 22/12 in 22 min) overwhelmed depleted Mavs. McDaniels' three straight threes in Q3 (extending lead from 17 to 30) epitomized superior talent destroying inferior opponent. Covered -14.5 by 9.5 points despite Q4 garbage time. This represents textbook fade of injury-ravaged team on schedule disadvantage. Would make this bet 100 times out of 100 under identical circumstances. Captured strong CLV (-102 vs closing -110), validating early identification of value."
