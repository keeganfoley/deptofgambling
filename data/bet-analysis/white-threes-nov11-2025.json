    "Well-reasoned bets can lose narrowly: Lost by exactly 0.5 threes despite all analysis pointing toward under",
    "Career-worst streaks eventually regress: Even at 27%, White is career 36.9% shooter; one decent night was inevitable",
    "Matchup history matters: Both 4+ three games came vs Philadelphia, suggesting something about this opponent generated volume",
    "White debuted new celebration (covering eyes/ears = see/hear no evil) acknowledging struggles",
    "This wasn't a breakout—still inefficient (35% FG) with slightly improved 3PT%"

  "verdict": "Excellent analysis with strong edge, but volume spike in close game created narrow bad beat. Grade: B+"
