    "Triple-doubles don't guarantee wins: Wembanyama and Castle's historic performances were wasted by defensive failures",
    "Desperation factor matters: Warriors' 6-game road skid created urgency we underestimated. Wounded team played like it.",

  "wouldBetAgain": false,
  "verdict": "Painful loss. Curry's nuclear 46 (with 22 in Q3) was unpredictable outlier. Spurs' defense collapsed when it mattered. While logic was sound (home dominance vs road-struggling Warriors), we can't model generational talent having career-level nights. 2U stake was too aggressive for -3.5 spread. Grade: D"
