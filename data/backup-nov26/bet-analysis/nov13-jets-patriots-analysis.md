# November 13, 2025 - Jets vs Patriots Analysis
## Game Summary
**Final Score:** Patriots 27, Jets 14
**Date:** Thursday Night Football, November 13, 2025
**Venue:** Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, MA

## Record: 2-3 (-0.86 units, -11.5% ROI)

---

## ✅ BET 1: UNDER 43.5 Total Points (-112) - 2.5U
### Result: WON (+2.23U)
**Final Total: 41 points (Patriots 27, Jets 14)**

### Why It Hit:
1. **Patriots Elite Run Defense**: Patriots came in with #1 run defense (79.2 YPG), completely neutralized Jets' run game
2. **Jets Offensive Struggles**: Jets offense was already struggling, couldn't move the ball consistently
3. **Thursday Night Football Trend**: TNF games historically lower-scoring (teams on short rest)
4. **Weather Factor**: Late November game in New England, cooler temperatures favor defense
5. **Defensive Game Script**: Patriots built lead early, milked clock with run game in 2nd half

### The Analysis:
The Patriots' run defense was exactly as advertised - they held Breece Hall to just 58 yards and forced the Jets into predictable passing situations. The Jets couldn't establish any rhythm offensively, and the Patriots' ball-control offense kept possessions limited. This was textbook under betting.

**Edge Rating: A+** - Great read on game environment

## ❌ BET 2: TreVeyon Henderson OVER 70.5 Rushing Yards (-112) - 2U
### Result: LOST (-2.00U)
**Henderson Stats: 3 TDs but under 70.5 yards rushing**

### Why It Missed:
1. **Goal-Line Vulture**: Henderson scored 3 TDs but got most of his touches inside the 10-yard line
2. **Game Script Changed**: Patriots got lead early, used clock-killing drives instead of explosive plays
3. **Passing Game Efficiency**: Drake Maye was efficient passing (25-of-34, 281 yards), less reliance on run
4. **Touchdown Variance**: Henderson's 3 TDs came on short yardage situations (1-5 yards each)
5. **RBBC Approach**: Patriots may have rotated backs more to keep Henderson fresh for goal-line situations

### The Flaw:
This is a classic case of **TD regression hiding yardage failure**. Henderson was incredibly valuable for fantasy/anytime TD bets, but the Patriots used him specifically as a goal-line back rather than a workhorse. When betting rushing yards, need to differentiate between "feature back volume" vs "TD specialist" usage.

**Lesson:** Don't confuse TD upside with yardage volume. Check snap share and target distribution, not just TD rates.

**Edge Rating: C** - Misread the role/usage

## ❌ BET 3: Drake Maye OVER 1.5 Passing TDs (-164) - 1.5U
### Result: LOST (-1.50U)
**Maye Stats: 25-of-34 (73.5%), 281 yards, 1 TD**

### Why It Missed:
1. **Henderson Goal-Line Dominance**: All 3 Patriots TDs came on Henderson rushes/receptions, not Maye passes
2. **Conservative Game Plan**: With lead and strong run game, Patriots didn't need to air it out
3. **Jets Pass Defense Improved**: Jets secondary actually played well, limited big plays
4. **Run-Heavy Red Zone**: Patriots went run-heavy inside the 20, didn't need to throw TDs
5. **Game Flow**: 27-14 lead was enough, no need to keep passing

### The Flaw:
The bet relied on Maye's **recent TD trend (averaging 2.3 TD/game)** but failed to account for:
- Small sample size (only 4 games)
- Opponent-specific game plan adjustments
- Goal-line personnel (Henderson was clearly the red zone weapon)

**Critical Error:** Betting on TD props without checking goal-line usage tendencies. Henderson had 3 TDs, showing Patriots wanted to run in the red zone, not pass.

**Lesson:** Recent TD averages can be misleading. Check:
- Red zone target share (not just overall targets)
- Opponent's red zone pass defense vs run defense
- Team's goal-line tendencies

**Edge Rating: D** - Ignored red zone context

## ✅ BET 4: Breece Hall UNDER 58.5 Rushing Yards (-110) - 1U
### Result: WON (+0.91U)
**Hall Stats: 14 rushes, 58 yards (exactly at the line)**

### Why It Hit:
1. **Patriots #1 Run Defense**: Patriots allowed just 79.2 YPG on the ground, NFL's best
2. **Jets Offensive Line Weakness**: Jets O-line struggled against Patriots' front 7
3. **Game Script**: Jets fell behind early, forced to pass more (abandoned run)
4. **Hall's Struggles vs Elite Defenses**: Hall had historically struggled vs top-10 run defenses
5. **Predictable Offense**: Without threat of explosive pass game, Patriots could load the box

### The Analysis:
This was a **matchup-based bet executed perfectly**. Patriots' run defense was elite, Jets had no counter-punch (poor passing game), and game script went exactly as expected (Jets fell behind, had to abandon run). Hall got exactly 58 yards - as close as it gets.

**Edge Rating: A** - Perfect matchup read

## ❌ BET 5: Jets +12.5 (-104) - 0.5U
### Result: LOST (-0.50U)
**Final Score: Patriots 27, Jets 14 (13-point margin)**

### Why It Missed (Lost by 0.5 points):
1. **Jets Couldn't Score Late**: Jets only managed 14 points total, never threatened comeback
2. **Patriots Dominated Both Sides**: Patriots controlled game wire-to-wire
3. **Division Rivalry Didn't Matter**: Jets had no answers for Patriots' game plan
4. **4th Quarter Clock Killing**: Patriots ran out clock, Jets never got ball back for potential cover
5. **Backdoor Cover Never Came**: Jets needed late TD to cover, never happened

### The Flaw:
The bet assumed **divisional rivalry = competitive game**, but:
- Patriots were clearly the better team (8-game win streak)
- Jets had no offensive weapons to keep pace
- Game was never in doubt, no garbage time opportunities

**Bad Beat Factor:** Lost by half a point (13 vs 12.5). If Jets had scored one more TD and Patriots missed XP, would've covered. But objectively, this was never a competitive game.

**Lesson:** Division games can be competitive, but not when there's a massive talent gap. Don't rely on "rivalry game" narratives when one team is clearly superior.

**Edge Rating: F** - Relied on narrative over fundamentals

## Overall Analysis

### What Went Right:
1. **Game total read was excellent** - Patriots defense and TNF trends played out perfectly
2. **Matchup-based prop (Hall under)** - Elite defense vs struggling offense is reliable

### What Went Wrong:
1. **TD props failed** - Didn't account for goal-line usage (Henderson got all TDs)
2. **Spread bet was narrative-driven** - Should've respected talent gap
3. **Henderson yardage bet** - Confused TD upside with volume

### Key Lessons:
1. **Separate TD props from yardage props** - Different game scripts favor different bets
2. **Check goal-line personnel** - Who gets red zone touches matters more than overall stats
3. **Don't bet on small sample trends** - Maye's 2.3 TD/game average was only 4 games
4. **Respect elite defenses** - Patriots' #1 run D was the real deal
5. **Avoid narrative-based spreads** - "Division game" doesn't overcome talent gap

### ROI Analysis:
- **Matchup-based bets (Under, Hall under):** 2-0, +3.14U (A+ ROI)
- **TD props (Maye, Henderson):** 0-2, -3.50U (Bad)
- **Spread bet:** 0-1, -0.50U (Narrative bet, bad)

**Bottom Line:** Stick to matchup-based analysis. Avoid TD props without checking goal-line usage. Never bet spreads based on rivalry narratives alone.
