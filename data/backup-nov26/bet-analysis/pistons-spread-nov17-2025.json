    "Jalen Duren's return produced historic performance - 31 points on 92.3% shooting (12-13 FG) in season-high game",
    "10-game win streak creates unstoppable momentum - first double-digit Pistons streak since 2007-08, covered -11 by 4 points",
    "Depth without Cade Cunningham validated - Daniss Jenkins (26 pts) and six double-figure scorers overwhelmed Pacers",
    "Pacers' road futility hit rock bottom - 0-7 away from home, lost by 15 despite Siakam's 29 points",
    "Home court advantage at Little Caesars Arena decisive - 19,058 fans created electric atmosphere, 8-1 home record",
    "Paint dominance (64-42) and rebounding (48-36) controlled game - physicality advantage overwhelming",
    "Bench scoring differential of +26 (44-18) proved too much for thin Pacers rotation",
    "20-4 run to start Q2 broke Pacers' will - lead went from 5 to 21 in six minutes, Duren scored 8 during stretch",
    "For quantitative operations: bet hot home favorites on win streaks vs worst road teams in league, spreads hit 70%+ in this spot",
    "Double-digit spreads risky but justified here - worst team in NBA (1-11) couldn't compete with best East team (11-2)"
  ],
  "wouldBetAgain": true,
  "verdict": "Elite handicapping producing expected results. Every element of pre-game thesis materialized perfectly: Duren's dominant return (31 pts, 92.3% FG), 10-game win streak momentum, Pacers' historic futility (0-7 road), home court advantage, depth without Cunningham. The 20-4 Q2 run (extending lead from 5 to 21) epitomized superior talent breaking inferior opponent. Pistons led wire-to-wire after early Q1, covering -11 by 4 points despite Pacers' garbage time Q4 rally. This represents textbook favorite spot: best home team on long win streak vs worst road team in league. Would make this bet 100 times out of 100 under identical circumstances. Double-digit spreads always risky, but this was justified - final margin of 15 validated the thesis completely."
