Hurts' 31 yards on 10 carries (3.1 YPC) vs season 5.1 YPC represents underperformance, but Lions defensive game plan (Hutchinson edge pressure, interior leverage) made QB runs difficult. More importantly, Eagles' game script centered on Barkley (26 carries) instead of Hurts' legs. Conservative playcalling in defensive battle limited Hurts' designed run volume. The 0.5-yard cover margin shows this was extremely fortunate - one less yard and bet loses. Right side but tight squeeze represents borderline bad process with lucky result."

    "Covered by 0.5 yards (31 vs 30.5) - tightest possible margin, sweated entire 4th quarter",
    "Low line (30.5 vs 42.3 season avg) provided critical cushion - without it, bet loses easily",
    "Hurts cleared with 6:18 left in 4th on 3-yard scramble - held breath rest of game",
    "Barkley dominated carries (26 vs Hurts' 10), reducing QB designed run opportunities",
    "10 carries included 6 designed runs + 4 scrambles - needed both elements to hit",
    "3.1 YPC well below season 5.1 YPC - efficiency failed but volume barely saved prop",
    "Low-scoring game (16-9) limited overall offensive opportunities and Hurts rushing usage",
    "If Hurts loses 1 yard anywhere (sack, negative scramble), bet loses - extremely fortunate",
    "For quantitative operations: QB rushing props in defensive battles carry massive variance",
    "Right side but tight squeeze - borderline bad process with lucky result",
    "Eagles' run-heavy approach favored Barkley (workhorse) over Hurts (mobile QB)",
    "Lesson: QB rushing props under 35 yards have minimal cushion even for mobile QBs"
  ],
  "wouldBetAgain": false,
  "verdict": "Fortunate cover that exposed thin margin of error. Hurts rushed for exactly 31 yards on 10 carries, clearing 30.5 by just 0.5 yards. If Hurts loses 1 yard anywhere (sack, tackle for loss on scramble), bet loses. While line of 30.5 was 11.8 below season average (42.3), game script proved problematic - Eagles leaned on Barkley (26 carries) instead of Hurts' legs, limiting designed QB runs. Low-scoring defensive battle (16-9) reduced overall opportunities. Hurts' 3.1 YPC vs season 5.1 YPC showed efficiency failure - only volume (10 carries) barely saved prop. Cleared line with 6:18 left in 4th quarter on 3-yard scramble, then sweated rest of game hoping for no negative plays. This represents right side with lucky result - 0.5-yard margin is coin-flip territory. While bet won, extreme variance and thin cushion make this questionable process. Would not make this bet again under identical circumstances - sweat factor too high for 1-unit stake."
