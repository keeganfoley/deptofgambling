Not analytical failure - fair line would have been Ohio -0.5 to Illinois State +0.5, so getting +1.5 provided thin cushion that wasn't enough."

    "Turnover advantages don't always translate to wins if shot selection poor",
    "Previous season results provide context but roster changes matter significantly",
    "Ohio's 9-2 run after ISU took lead was pivotal momentum shift - execution matters in close games",

  "wouldBetAgain": false,
  "verdict": "Slight analytical edge existed (offensive efficiency +3.6, historical dominance) but stake sizing was inappropriate. 1.5 units on a 4-7% edge is too aggressive. Should have been 0.5-1.0 unit max. Close game came down to rebounding and key run - not a process failure, but stake sizing needs improvement for thin-edge spots."
