  "wouldBetAgain": true,
  "verdict": "Sound process. 38.5-point spread dramatically overreacted to opening game results. KenPom's 28-point projection + buy game dynamics (30-36 typical finals) = strong case for Jackson State +38.5. Edge realized through Louisville's pace control and Jackson State's offensive regression to competence."
