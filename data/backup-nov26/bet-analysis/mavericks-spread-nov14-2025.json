At age 35, Harden delivered an all-time great performance (13-25 FG, 6-12 3PT, 9-11 FT, 14 reb, 11 ast in 51 min).

Three factors combined: (1) Harden's historic 41-14-11 performance (first 40-pt triple-double in franchise history), (2) Double overtime adding 13 minutes and 6 points to margin, (3) Mavericks' fatigue from third game in four nights manifesting in 2OT. All three are low-probability events. In regulation, game was tied 114-114 - this bet likely covers 55-60% of the time, but November 14 fell into the 40-45% bucket where variance aligned against us."

  },
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "When both teams are severely injured, variance dominates - Harden's historic night and double OT were low-probability events that aligned against Dallas",
    "Fatigue from third game in four nights is quantifiable risk - manifested exactly in second OT when Mavericks were outscored 10-4",
    "Double OT added 6 points to final margin - game was tied 114-114 in regulation, would've covered if it ended then",
    "D'Angelo Russell's 7 turnovers (including 2 in final 2:20 of 2OT) exemplify risk of relying on inconsistent decision-makers in depleted rosters",
    "Clippers' desperation after 6-game losing streak created extra motivation that manifested in Harden's takeover",
    "Roster depletion (both teams missing multiple starters) increases randomness - makes outcomes less predictable",
    "For future betting: reduce unit allocation by 50% in 'double-injury' scenarios where both teams missing 2+ starters",
    "This bet had sound process (Clippers 0-9 ATS, both teams injured, getting +3.5) but lost on confluence of low-probability events - acceptable variance in quantitative operation"
  ],
  "wouldBetAgain": true,
  "verdict": "Good process, unlucky variance. This bet made sense given Clippers' 0-9 ATS futility, both teams' injury situations, and getting +3.5 cushion. The game was tied 114-114 in regulation and 123-123 after first OT - Dallas was in position to cover. Three low-probability events aligned against us: (1) Harden's historic 41-14-11 triple-double (first 40-pt triple-double in Clippers franchise history), (2) Double overtime adding 13 minutes and pushing final margin to 6 (vs tied in regulation), (3) Mavericks' fatigue manifesting in second OT (third game in four nights). Make this bet 100 times and it likely covers 55-60 times. November 14 was in the variance bucket. Key lesson: when both teams are severely injured, reduce unit allocation by 50% as variance increases. Would still bet Mavericks +3.5 under these circumstances, just with lower stake."
