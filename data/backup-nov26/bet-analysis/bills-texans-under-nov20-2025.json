  "wouldBetAgain": true,
  "verdict": "Solid handicapping of defensive matchup. Two elite defenses + backup QB = under. Simple thesis, perfect execution. 43 total points under 44.5 - covered by 1.5. Texans under trend (8 of 11) is real and exploitable. This correlated perfectly with Texans +5.5 - low-scoring game helped both bets. Would bet this exact scenario repeatedly."
