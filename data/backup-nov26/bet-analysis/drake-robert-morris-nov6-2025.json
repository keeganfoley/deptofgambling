Unpredictable factors: Overtime forced by last-second block (variance), coaching change altered Drake's elite defensive identity (58.9 to 81 PPG allowed), high-scoring OT (24 points vs. typical 8-12). The 150.5 line correctly anticipated low-scoring regulation but couldn't account for OT variance."

    "Drake's dead-last tempo (364th) strongly supported Under - process was sound",

    "High-scoring OT (24 points vs. typical 8-12) created bad beat scenario",
    "Coaching changes matter significantly - Drake's defense allowed 22.1 PPG above average",
    "In 40-minute games, this Under wins 70-75% of the time based on tempo/historical data",
    "Bad beat ≠ bad process: 20.8% edge with 72% true probability was excellent value",
    "Stake sizing (2.0 units on 20.8% edge) was appropriate given massive historical edge"

  "wouldBetAgain": true,
  "verdict": "Classic bad beat. Process was sound with massive edge (20.8%) and strong historical foundation (Drake 87.1% under rate, dead-last tempo). Regulation total (136) validated analysis perfectly. Lost exclusively to overtime variance (last-second block + high-scoring 24-point OT). In 40-minute games, this bet wins 70-75% of the time. Would absolutely bet again under identical circumstances - cannot predict overtime buzzer-beater blocks."
