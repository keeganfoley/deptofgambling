This removed Pistons' best player and primary ball handler. While Pistons still heavily favored (9-game win streak), Cunningham absence created uncertainty. Hedge with Pacers +10.5 creates middle opportunity: if Pistons win by exactly 11, 12, 13, or 14 points, BOTH bets win. Risk management to protect 2.5U Pistons bet."

Jalen Duren's unexpected dominance (31 pts, 92.3% FG in return) was unknown X-factor, but broader context should have prevented hedge. Market line not moving toward Pacers after Cunningham news signaled sharps knew Pistons would still dominate. Lost both sides of middle (Pistons won by 15) - worst-case scenario.
