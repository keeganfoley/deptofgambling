    "Week 9 explosion created market overreaction BUT also defensive focus from opponents",
    "Bad beat ≠ bad process. 8.5% edge with 62% true probability was solid pre-game value",

  ],
  "wouldBetAgain": false,
  "verdict": "Bad beat, not bad process. Pre-game analysis showed moderate positive EV (8.5% edge). However, miss resulted from convergent low-probability events that fell outside predictable variance: targeted defensive bracketing, offensive line injuries, and historic pass rush dominance. The line at 64.5 yards reasonably captured Bowers' talent and opportunity given available information. Stake sizing (1.5u on 8.5% edge) was slightly aggressive - would reduce to 1.0u in similar moderate-edge situations."
